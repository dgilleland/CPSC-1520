    Roadmaps are easier to publish once the blueprints are finalized. What you see here is a **work-in-progress** (WIP) that I *whipped up* (see what I did?) for your enjoyment.
    
    Look for this notice to disappear once the plans for this site become clearer in my own mind. (*See [issue 42](https://github.com/dgilleland/CPSC-1520/issues/42).*)

## QuickStart Tutorials

Did you know that you can learn JavaScript without knowing *any* HTML or CSS? You can!

If that's your situation, then consider looking at the **QuickStart** tutorials. All you need is NodeJS, a terminal, and an editor like Visual Studio Code. See the [System Setup](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0010/) on how to install these tools.

Here's a summary of what each QuickStart covers.

- [Intro to JavaScript]()
- [JavaScript Math]()
- [Complex Data Types]()
- [Functions]()
- [Conditionals]()
- [Looping]()
- [Arrays]()
