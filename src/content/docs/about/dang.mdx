    *"Dang it, Jim! I'm a programmer, not a web designer! I can make it **live**, but it won't be pretty...."*

    ##### My Wheelhouse

    No bones about it. I've worked mostly "solo" in IT. It's partly because most of my years have been spent *teaching* people how to program. And though a career as a programming instructor is spent re-hashing the fundamentals, I have tried to keep up with the "architecture" and "engineering" aspects of software development.
    
    TBH, my hands-on in "real-world" areas of our IT industry have been mostly in the hobby format. Still, I grok as much as I can, and I get to do the occassional outside contract to keep my feet wet.

    ##### Design

    It's hard to touch computer programming without brushing up with (or falling into) the challenges and pitfalls of *visual design*.
    
    <Image src={goodDesign} alt="Content vs. Functionality vs. Presentation" class="float-start mr-3" width="200"/>

    Of the three Pillars of Software - Content | Functionality | Presentation - I'm pretty good at Functionality. I also write decent Content (and I can hack screenshots for visuals). But Presentation...? That's where my skills devolve into monkey-patching (at best).

    However, things are improving for me in this regard!
    
    Thanks in large part to advancements with things like <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a>, <a href="https://starlight.astro.build/" target="_blank">Starlight</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind</a>, I'm starting to make things I am proud to show off. And I'm *so happy* for <a href="https://www.refactoringui.com/" target="_blank">Refactoring UI</a>! These have allowed me to make what I think are decent looking sites and applications.
    
    Who knows? Maybe I'll improve enough to open-source some of the half-baked ad-hoc tools/apps I have laying around.
