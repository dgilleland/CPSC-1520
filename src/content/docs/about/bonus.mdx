import { Aside, Badge, Card, CardGrid, Code, FileTree, Icon, LinkButton, LinkCard, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

There really is no end to all of the extra resources you can find on JavaScript. Here are some choice ones from me.

{/*
- <LinkButton href="" target="_blank"></LinkButton>
*/}

- <LinkButton href="https://swimburger.net/blog/web/hidden-gem-take-screenshots-using-built-in-commands-in-chrome-edge" target="_blank" variant='minimal'>Take screenshots using built-in commands in Chrome/Edge</LinkButton>
