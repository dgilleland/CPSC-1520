<Image src={dg} alt="Dan Gilleland (NAIT)" class="float-end" width="75" /> My name is Dan Gilleland. I've created this site as a place to put my ad-hoc resources that support [my CPSC-1520 classes](#audience--content-advisory) in January 2025. Why this site instead of the official <abbr title="Learning Management System">LMS</abbr>? Because this is **way easier to maintain**, and the effort involved in authoring doesn't need to be hindered by the clunkyness of most <abbr title="Learning Management System">LMS</abbr>es available today.

## Using this site

Use the side-bar site navigation if you know where you want to go. Some of the links in the navigation jump to the official documentation on the Mozilla Developer Network; these will have the <Badge text="MDN" size="small" variant="note" /> badge next to the link and will open in a new browser tab.

If you are unsure of where to find what you're looking for, then use the built-in search (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>). It's pretty good, and is part of the [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) framework this site is built on. Alternatively, check out the first item in each of the following areas:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Your First Tutorial" href="/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0030/" />
  <LinkCard title="How-To Guides" href="/CPSC-1520/guides/0010/" />
  <LinkCard title="Explanations" href="/CPSC-1520/explanations/0010/" />
  <LinkCard title="References" href="/CPSC-1520/reference/0000/" />
</CardGrid>

<Aside title="Where is it?">
This site is undergoing active changes. If you've been directed here by me (Dan) for a very recent update (like, in the last few minutes), and the content I pointed you to doesn't appear, then *force* a refresh of your browser by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>

## Audience & Content Advisory

**On this site** you will find tutorials, how-to guides, references, and [explanations](/CPSC-1520/explanations/0000). I am applying the [DiÃ¡taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#the-four-kinds-of-documentation) in organizing and authoring the content on this site. You can view the [commit history](https://github.com/dgilleland/CPSC-1520/commits/main/) to see what's new.

<Aside type="caution">
This site is *temporary*, so don't expect any bookmarks to work after June 2025. I am, however, planning on taking the work done here and publishing it into a longer-lived site on **Programming Fundamentals for JavaScript/TypeScript**.

## Student Workbook and Integrations ðŸ’¯

If you're one of my students, then you know that I *daily* reference Student Workbooks. You can add any of these tutorials to your workbook on your own (though I may give guidance on where to put them for in-class lessons). Here's how you can do that.

<Steps>
1. First, pick out some tutorial you want to add to your workbook (for example, [Querying the DOM](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0030)).
1. Choose a place in your workbook. For example, create a `query-dom` folder under the `src` folder.

   <FileTree>
   - docs/
   - src/
     - ...
     - query-dom/ Sample subfolder for your specific tutorial
     - ...
   - ReadMe.md
   </FileTree>

1. Follow the tutorial by creating the file(s) and adding the provided assets.
</Steps>
