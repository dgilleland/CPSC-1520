<Image src={dg} alt="Dan Gilleland (NAIT)" class="float-end" width="75" /> My name is <span lang="en" aria-label="dan GIL-el-land">**Dan Gilleland**</span>. I began this site in January 2025 as a place to put my ad-hoc resources that support [my CPSC-1520 classes](#audience--content-advisory). I'm continuing to use this for my **September 2025** classes as well.

Why this site instead of the official <abbr title="Learning Management System">LMS</abbr>? It's *much* easier to maintain. The effort to create content isn't held back by the clunkiness of many <abbr title="Learning Management System">LMS</abbr> platforms today.

My goal is to take you on a journey. It is one that will take you (an aspiring web developer) on a guided tour of the fundamentals of JavaScript. It's not an end-goal in itself. Rather, it's a starting point. Learning how to program is a lifelong journey, and it can take you to places unexpected. I want to give you a good start.

## Using this site

Use the side-bar site navigation if you know where you want to go. Some navigation links go to the official documentation on the Mozilla Developer Network. These links have the <Badge text="MDN" size="small" variant="note" /> badge next to the link and will open in a new browser tab.

If you are unsure of where to find what you're looking for, then use the built-in search (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>). It's pretty good, and is part of the [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) framework this site is built on. Alternatively, check out the first item in each of the following areas:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Your First Tutorial" href="/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0012/" />
  <LinkCard title="How-To Guides" href="/CPSC-1520/guides/0010/" />
  <LinkCard title="Explanations" href="/CPSC-1520/explanations/0010/" />
  <LinkCard title="References" href="/CPSC-1520/reference/0000/" />
</CardGrid>

<Aside title="Where is it?">
This site is undergoing active changes. If I (Dan) just directed you here for a quick update, and you can't see the content, try refreshing your browser. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> to do that.

## Audience & Content Advisory

**On this site** you will find tutorials, how-to guides, references, and [explanations](/CPSC-1520/explanations/0000). I am applying the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#the-four-kinds-of-documentation) in organizing and authoring the content on this site. You can view the [commit history](https://github.com/dgilleland/CPSC-1520/commits/main/) to see what's new.

<Aside type="caution">
This site is *temporary*, so don't expect any bookmarks to work after December 2025. I'm hoping to publish this work on a permanent site about **Programming Fundamentals for JavaScript and TypeScript**.
</Aside>

For my students this semester, you can find my <a target="_blank" href="https://dgilleland.github.io/schedule">teaching schedule</a> online (blank parts of my schedule are taken up with prep, meetings, etc.). I also use an **Instructor Workbook** for each section to track what we've covered and what's upcoming. Choose the workbook for your section and **review the agenda**.

## Student Workbook and Integrations 💯

If you're one of my students, then you know that I *daily* reference Student Workbooks. You can add any of these tutorials to your workbook yourself.

<Aside title="In-Class Instructions">
I might guide you in-class on *where* to place them for in-person lessons or as practice/homework assignments.
</Aside>

Here are general steps you can follow.

<Steps>
1. First, pick out some tutorial you want to add to your workbook (for example, [Querying the DOM](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0030)).
1. Choose a place in your workbook. For example, create a `query-dom` folder under the `src` folder.

   <FileTree>
   - docs/
   - src/
     - ...
     - query-dom/ Sample subfolder for your specific tutorial
     - ...
   - ReadMe.md
   </FileTree>

1. Follow the tutorial by creating the file(s) and adding the provided assets.
</Steps>

If you are looking for my template repository for my CPSC-1520 student workbooks, it's located on GitHub at this URL:
