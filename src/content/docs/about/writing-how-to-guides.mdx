## [How-To Guides](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/#the-language-of-how-to-guides)

- `This guide shows you how to…`
  - Describe clearly the problem or task that the guide shows the user how to solve.
- `If you want x, do y. To achieve w, do z.`
  - Use conditional imperatives.
- `Refer to the x reference guide for a full list of options.`
  - Don’t pollute your practical how-to guide with every possible thing the user might do related to x.
