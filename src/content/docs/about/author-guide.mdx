### Goals

The primary focus for this site is as a support for students learning **JavaScript**. The scope of content is to fit the current CPSC-1520 course requirements, but there may be some "bonus" docs created for what I (Dan) envison in an improved/future guide for JavaScript and Typescript. A few articles exist to help them with surrounding tasks, like working in the terminal or using `git`.

## General Guides

- When first creating a document, ensure the frontmatter `draft: true` is included. That way, readers won't loose confidence in the site by visiting pages that are mostly empty.
- Don't wait for it to be 100% complete before publishing. 75% is good enough.
  - You can publish it by removing the `draft` frontmatter or set its value to `false`.
- Be sure to add a reference to the GitHub issue that the document is addressing.

  ```mdx
  <Aside title="Work-In-Progress (WIP)" type="caution">
  *See [issue 26](https://github.com/dgilleland/CPSC-1520/issues/26).*
  </Aside>
  ```

  - Keep the <abbr title="Work In Progress">WIP</abbr> at the top of the document.
  - Remember to remove that WIP/issue notice when the issue is closed and the document is complete.
- After closing the document's issue, you can reference issue #23 in your commit message for any typos, grammatical edits, etc. It's a catch-all issue for minor edits, so that the primary issue for the doc isn't littered with meaningless commit references on GitHub.
