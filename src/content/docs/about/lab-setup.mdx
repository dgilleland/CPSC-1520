Your instructor may be providing coding labs and assignments via GitHub Classroom. This guide is to help you in accepting and cloning these repositories onto your computer.

<Aside type="tip" title="Continuous Submission">
Labs and assignments delivered via git repositories (such as through *GitHub*) are designed for ***Continuous Submission***. This means that you can (and *should*) do **frequent commits** of your work in order to *show the progress* you are making on the assignment.

In other words, you can do continous updates to your work until the due date.

And by the way, don't forget to `git push` your work. (You can do this as often as you wish, up to the cutoff/due date.)
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Accept the assignment from the link provided by your instructor.
1. When you navigate to the repository on GitHub, click the green "Code" button and copy the *HTTPS Web Url* to your clipboard.
1. Open a terminal window on your computer and navigate to the folder where you keep your labs/assignments for the course.

    Your instructor will have given you guidance on where to put these on your computer. **Follow their instructions!**

1. Type `git clone [paste-from-your-clipboard]` into the terminal. **Note:** You need to paste in your *HTTPS Web Url* that you copied earlier.

    For example, here is a lab that was accepted by <a href="https://github.com/stew-dent" target="_blank">Stewart Dent Jr.</a>.

    ```ps title="Sample cloning command"
    git clone https://github.com/SchoolCourseOrg/prog-0101-in-class-lab-2-a03-stew-dent
    ```

1. Now you can begin work on your assignment. Remember to do frequent commits!

    ```ps title="Making git commits"
    git add .
    git commit -m "Describe what changes you made"
    ```

    And don't forget to push!!

    ```ps title="Pushing is how you submit your work"
    git push
    ```
</Steps>
