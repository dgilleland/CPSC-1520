In this tutorial, we will set up our computer environment for JavaScript development. This involves [getting a GitHub account](#-sign-up-for-github) and [installing certain tools](#installing-the-tools) (*i.e.: computer programs*).

Along the way, we will configure our primary tool - Visual Studio Code - with the recommended extensions for this course. Most of these tools are *command-line* tools, meaning that you typically run them from the terminal environment (see [*To-Be-Written*] for details). In this tutorial, I'll be using the terms 'tool' and 'program' interchagably, as they mean basically the same thing in this context.

<Aside title="One-Time Setup">
Getting the tools on your computer is a one-time setup, and you might already have them installed. You can check if something is installed by opening a terminal and typing the program's name followed by `--version` to get the current version number. If you get the tool's version number, then it's alreay installed and you can skip this tutorial.

Here's my set of tools and their version numbers (*as of Jan 2025*). Your version numbers don't have to match mine exactly, but if they are earlier versions, they shouldn't be *too* early.

```ps
code --version
# 1.96.2
git --version
# git version 2.43.0.windows.1
node --version
# v22.12.0
npm --version
# 10.1.0
pnpm --version
# 9.10.0
gh --version
# gh version 2.41.0 (2024-01-08)
```

If you get a result saying that the program is not available (e.g.: `'npm' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file`), then you need to follow the steps identified below for that specific tool.

## <Icon name="github" class="starlight-aside__icon" /> Sign Up for GitHub

<Image src={Mascot} alt="The Octocat is the primary GitHub Mascot" width="200" class="float-right" />

You can <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signup">get a GitHub account</a> for free. GitHub is a hosting platform for the **git** version control system. I've been using GitHub since 2012, and my life has been happier, simpler and more productive ever since!

<Aside type="caution" title="Check Your Account Settings">
You should have 2FA turned on for your account. See my [GitHub Account](/CPSC-1520/about/github-account/) page for how to access your account settings.
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
There's another (more important) reason to sign up for GitHub.

I (Dan) require you to submit your assignments through GitHub, so if you don't have an account, you won't pass the course! *(It's probably the same if you have a different instructor, or they wouldn't have pointed you here.)*
</Aside>

## Installing the tools

The two key tools are <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">**Visual Studio Code**</a> (*VS Code*) and <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">**git**</a>. All the other tools are important, but you will be using these two the most. I've put these installation instructions in order of what tools should probably be installed first. Don't panic if you've installed them in a slightly different order; it should work out in the end.

Also note that the following instructions are geared mostly for Windows 11. They will generally work on Windows 10 and Mac, but you should be prepared to adjust some steps accordingly.

### Visual Studio Code

We use VS Code primarily as an *editor* to write our source code, but it's much more than just a **code editor**. It's an *extensible IDE* (Integrated Development Environment), with several common support features built in. Here's how to get it installed.

<Steps>
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code Website</a> and click the *Download* button for your operating system.
1. Run the installation file. You will be presented with a number of prompts with default settings and options.
1. If you get an alert warning about the "User Installer", simply click the OK button.

   <Image src={CodeUserInstall} alt="Alert" />

1. You can accept all the default settings. There is, however, one setting I often prefer to turn on. I like to turn on both of the `Add "Open with Code"` actions.

   <Image src={CodeAddOpen} alt="Alert" />

1. Once installation is complete, you are given an option to open VS Code for the first time. Feel free to check it out and look around. :)
</Steps>

### Git for Windows/Mac

`git` is the **version control software** that the vast majority of programmers use every day. While there are several <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> tools built around it, `git` itself is a tool that you run from the terminal. Follow the steps below to install on your computer.

<LinkButton href="https://github.com/git-guides/install-git" icon='github' iconPlacement='start' target='_blank'>More details on installing git (from GitHub)</LinkButton>

<Steps>
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git download page</a> and click the link for your operating system (e.g.:  <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/win">*Windows*</a>).
1. Follow the instructions for your operating system.
   <Aside type="note" title="Mac Users">
   You might need to install <a target="_blank" href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> before you can install git for Mac.
   </Aside>
1. (**Windows**) Run the installation file and follow the prompts. You can accept all the default settings. For advanced usage, however, you may want to have git use Visual Studio Code as the default editor. You can turn that on, if you wish, or leave it with the default setting.

   <Image src={GitEditor} alt="Alert" />

1. Our next step is to tell git what user name and email to use when performing commits. Start by opening a terminal window (press the Windows key and type `terminal`).

   <Aside type="tip">
   If you already have a terminal window open, you should close it and re-open it. The reason is that we just installed git, and the terminal window only knows what programs are available to it at the time we open the terminal window. Closing and re-starting the terminal helps it to get the most recent information.
   </Aside>

1. Type `git --version` to ensure that git is installed and available. If it's not, take a look at the tip in the previous step.
1. Type `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` to set your name for git (e.g.: `"Stewart Dent"`).
1. Type `git config --global user.email "Your Email"` to set your email for git (e.g.: `"stewdent@gmail.com"`)
1. Type `git config user.name` to view the name that you set.
1. Type `git config user.email` to view the email that you set.
</Steps>

### Node

Node is a **run-time environment** that allows you to run JavaScript *outside* of the browser. As JavaScript developers, we'll use Node primarily as the way we set up our [JavaScript Projects][*TODO: Link to future article*].

When you install Node, you actually get two command-line programs on your computer: `node` and `npm`. You can learn more about that in [*TODO: Link to future article*].

<Steps>
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS Website</a> and click the download button for the <abbr title="Long-Term Support">LTS</abbr> version.
1. Run the installation file and follow the prompts. You can accept all the default settings.
1. Check that the `node` and `npm` programs are accessible. Close any terminal windows you have open, and then open a new termial window (this refreshes the terminal's memory of what programs have been installed).
1. In the terminal window, type the following

   ```ps
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

1. If you get an error about the `npm` not being an "executable script", it's likely a security/policy issue. You can resolve that by entering the following:

   ```ps
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   This command will tell your computer to trust remotely-signed applications (like `npm`) for the current user. For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="https://lazyadmin.nl/powershell/running-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system/">this article</a>.
1. Double-check that you can now access/use `npm` by checking the installed version.

   ```ps
   npm --version
   ```

   You should see information on the installed version of `npm`.
</Steps>

### PNPM

PNPM is a modern alternative to using the `npm` tool. I strongly prefer using `pnpm` over `npm` because it's very fast and efficient!

<Aside type="tip" title="Node + PNPM for Mac Users">
   For those of you who use a Mac, this article by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.squash.io/tutorials/">SquashLabs</a> goes into more depth on the installation process.

   <LinkButton target="_blank" icon='external' href="https://www.squash.io/how-to-install-pnpm-on-mac/">How to install pnpm on Mac</LinkButton>
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Remember how I said it didn't matter too much about the order of installing these tools? Well, this is an exception. If you haven't installed Node yet, go back to [those steps](#node) and complete the process before you continue installing pnpm.
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://pnpm.io/installation">pnpm installation page</a>.
1. Follow the instructions for your operating system. On Windows, you can run the following from a terminal window.

   ```ps
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

   This will install pnpm as a global npm package, meaning you can use `pnpm` directly from your terminal.

   <Aside type="caution" title="Powershell Installation Warning">
   There is a note on using a Powershell installation script for Windows computers, but you should note the caution on their site about potential conflicts with Windows Defender.

   <Image src={PnpmDefender} alt="Alert" />
   
   Following their recommendation, and since you should already have [Node](#node) installed, install via `npm` as noted above.
   </Aside>
</Steps>

### GitHub CLI

The GitHub CLI is a tool that brings some GitHub-specific goodness to working with git. I find it helps me immensely with administrative tasks (creating issues, viewing workflows, etc.), but probably the most frequent way I use it is to quickly open up the GitHub site for my local repository by typing `gh browse` in the terminal.

<Steps>
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://cli.github.com/">GitHub CLI site</a> and click the download button.
1. Run the installation file and follow the prompts. You can accept all the default settings.
1. Once again, we need to do a bit of authorization setup, but this time we will use the terminal that's built into Visual Studio Code.
1. If Visual Studio Code is open, close it and restart (for pretty much the same reasons mentioned for the Windows terminal when we installed git).
1. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> (the backtick key near the top left of your keyboard). This key combination is used to open and close (*toggle*) the terminal window in VS Code.
1. Type `gh --version` to ensure that the GitHub CLI is installed and available.
1. Ensure that you are logged into GitHub.com in your default browser. Then, in the terminal, type `gh auth login` to authenticate the GitHub CLI.
   1. Follow the prompts to authenticate.
   1. You can use the `gh auth status` command to view your authentication status when you are done following the prompts.
</Steps>

### VS Code and GitHub Authorization

Visual Studio Code integrates with git and GitHub, but you need to sign into GitHub from within Visual Studio Code. There are various ways to do this, but the steps below work fairly well.

<Steps>
1. Make sure you are signed into GitHub in your web browser. Visual Studio Code will be using the browser to help complete the authentication between it and GitHub.
1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
1. Click on the source code tab from the sidebar (or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd>).

   <Image src={SourceCode} alt="Extensions Icon" />

1. Click the `Clone Repository` button. A dialog will appear at the top of VS Code.
1. Click `Clone from GitHub`, and that will start the process of Visual Studio's interaction with your browser to complete the authentication process.
1. Be sure to follow the remaining prompts as VS Code and your browser interact. *Don't rush* the process, or you might miss one of the confirmation dialogs that pops up.
1. Once you're authenticated and control is given back to VS Code, the cloning window will be waiting for you to choose which repository to clone. Simply press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
Using git and GitHub with Visual Studio Code is something you do several times a day. Numerous resources exist to help you get started. One recent resource I ran across comes from It's FOSS titled <a target="_blank" href="https://itsfoss.com/vs-code-github/">How to Connect GitHub to VS Code [Step by Step]</a>. Check it out, as it goes a bit beyond the setup detailed here.
</Aside>

### VS Code Extensions

<Image src={VSCode} alt="Extensions Icon" />


Extensions are a great way to improve your productivity and simplify your coding experience. Here are the recommended extensions for this course:

- <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one">**Markdown All in One**</a> (by Yu Zhang)
- <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf">**Markdown PDF**</a> (by yzane)
- <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid">**Markdown Preview Mermaid Support**</a> (by Matt Bierner)

<Aside type="caution">

Installing extensions is super easy, but be careful not to go overboard. Some extensions can interfere with each other.
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Launch VS Code and click the Extensions icon.
1. Enter the name of the extension you want in the search bar.
1. Click the *Install* button for the extension.
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
You might be used to using the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">**Live Server**</a> extension (by Ritwick Dey) to preview your websites. However, the recommended way to create and run websites in this course is to use [a Node project with the Vite dev server](/CPSC-1520/guides/0040/).
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

### Unknown Program

Depending on the security setup on your computer, you might right into a problem when you check the version of the command-line tool(s) you've just installed. For example, when running `npm --version`, you *might* see the following.

> <code class="text-red-600">File ... cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system....</code>

Or, if you have installed `pnpm` from some method other than the one listed in [step 3 above](#pnpm), you might get an error like this.

> <code class="text-red-600">pnpm : The term 'pnpm' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program....</code>

You might have this problem for other command-line tools as well, so these steps should work for all of the tools installed in this tutorial. If this is happening for you, here's how you fix it (and if you don't have this problem, then skip this section).

<Steps>
1. Entering the following in the terminal window.

   ```ps
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   This command will tell your computer to trust remotely-signed applications (like `npm`) for the current user. For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="https://lazyadmin.nl/powershell/running-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system/">this article</a>.
1. Double-check that you can now access/use your command-line tool by checking the installed version. For example, to check `npm`, type:

   ```ps
   npm --version`
   ```

   You should see information on the installed version of `npm`.
</Steps>

### Stuck in the VIM/VI Editor?

If you do a `git pull` and find yourself in the vim or vi editor (the default), you might wonder how to exit out of the editor. Try pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd> (note that these are the capital letters 'Z'). If that doesn't work, then just click the trash can icon (if you're in the VS Code terminal) or just close the external terminal window to abort the command.

Why does this happen? Two reasons.

First, your `git pull` is pulling in commits that fit "before" any local commits you have in your repository, and git wants you to enter a message for the merge it's trying to perform. (`git pull` is the equivalent of a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge`.)

Secondly, the *real* reason you're in Vim or Vi is because you didn't choose "VS Code as Git's default editor" when you [installed the software](#git-for-windowsmac) above. No worries, though. You can reset git to use VS Code as the editor by running the following command in the terminal.

```ps
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

The next time you do a `git pull`, any merging messages will open in the VS Code editor and git will wait for you to enter your message and close that tab in your editor before completing the merge. It can be worthwhile to pend a bit of time checking out the various [terminal commands for git](/CPSC-1520/reference/1000/#git), so that you are more comfortable using it from the command line.

### Resolving Diverging Branches

This isn't really an installation issue, but it is one that potentially relates to the `git pull` above. If you have local changes in your git history that aren't in the remote AND you have changes in your remote that aren't in your local repository, you may get the message "You have divergent branches ...". Here's a quick way to resolve this (assuming you don't have any *merge conflicts*):

```ps
git pull --rebase origin main
```

<Aside type="tip">
   Do you get an error on `` that says it doesn't know about a "main" branch? Then you might have your remote default branch named "master" (an older name). Run this instead.

   ```ps
   git pull --rebase origin master
   ```
</Aside>

## Updating Your Tools

The programs you install to help you write code will often be updated over time. Some tools get updated frequently (VS Code is a good example, as new versions are published on a monthly basis). VS Code will open a pop-up when a new version is available. For all of the other programs, I recommend you to re-visit those download sites to see the prescribed process for updating.

----

## Next Steps

Another important part of software development is **version control**. Odds are, if you are using this site as part of your course, your instructor will want you to be using git as your version control system. They'll also likely get you to use GitHub to host your code online. The next tutorial gives you a quick intro to the practice of version control.
