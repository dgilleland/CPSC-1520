<Aside title="Work-In-Progress (WIP)" type="caution">
*See [issue 2](https://github.com/dgilleland/CPSC-1520/issues/2).*
</Aside>

In this tutorial, we will set up our development environment for JavaScript development. This involves [getting a GitHub account](#-sign-up-for-github) and [installing certain tools](#installing-the-tools) (*i.e.: computer programs*).

Along the way, we will configuring our primary tool - Visual Studio Code - with the recommended extensions for this course. Most of these tools are *command-line* tools, meaning that you typically run them from the terminal environment (see [*To-Be-Written*] for details). In this tutorial, I'll be using the terms 'tool' and 'program' interchagably, as they mean basically the same thing in this context.

<Aside title="One-Time Setup">
Getting the tools on your computer is a one-time setup, and you might already have them installed. You can check if something is installed by opening a terminal and typing the program's name followed by `--version` to get the current version number. If you get the tool's version number, then it's alreay installed and you can skip this tutorial.

Here's my set of tools and their version numbers (*as of Jan 2025*).

```ps
git --version
# git version 2.42.0.windows.2
code --version
# 1.96.2
node --version
# v22.12.0
npm --version
# 10.1.0
pnpm --version
# 9.10.0
gh --version
# gh version 2.31.0 (2023-06-20)
```

If you get a result saying that the program is not available (e.g.: `'npm' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file`), then you need to follow the steps identified below for that specific tool.

## <Icon name="github" class="starlight-aside__icon" /> Sign Up for GitHub

You can <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signup">get a GitHub account</a> for free. GitHub is a hosting platform for the **git** version control system. I've been using GitHub since 2012, and my life has been happier, simpler and more productive ever since!

## Installing the tools

The two key tools are <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">**Visual Studio Code**</a> (*VS Code*) and <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">**git**</a>. All the other tools are important, but

### Git for Windows/Mac

`git` is the **version control software** that the vast majority of programmers use every day. While there are several <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> tools built around it, `git` itself is a tool that you run from the terminal.

<Steps>
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git download page</a> and click the link for your operating system (e.g.:  <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/win">*Windows*</a>).
1. Follow the instructions for your operating system.
1. (**Windows**) Run the installation file and follow the prompts. You can accept all the default settings.
</Steps>

### Visual Studio Code

We use VS Code primarily as an *editor* to write our source code, but it's much more than just a **code editor**. It's an *extensible IDE* (Integrated Development Environment), with several common support features built in. Here's how to get it installed.

<Steps>
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code Website</a> and click the *Download* button for your operating system.
1. Run the installation file and follow the prompts. You can accept all the default settings.
</Steps>

### Node

Node is a **run-time environment** that allows you to run JavaScript *outside* of the browser. As JavaScript developers, we'll use Node primarily as the way we set up our [JavaScript Projects][*TODO: Link to future article*].

When you install Node, you actually get two command-line programs on your computer: `node` and `npm`. You can learn more about that in [*TODO: Link to future article*].

<Steps>
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS Website</a> and click the download button for the <abbr title="Long-Term Support">LTS</abbr> version
1. Run the installation file and follow the prompts. You can accept all the default settings.
</Steps>

### PNPM

PNPM is a modern alternative to using the `npm` tool. I strongly prefer using `pnpm` over `npm` because it's very fast and efficient!

<Steps>
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://pnpm.io/installation">pnpm installation page</a> and follow the instructions for your operating system.
</Steps>

### GitHub CLI

The GitHub CLI is a tool that brings some GitHub-specific goodness to working with git. I find it helps me immensely with administrative tasks (creating issues, viewing workflows, etc.), but probably the most frequent way I use it is to quickly open up my GitHub site for my local repository - `gh browse`.

<Steps>
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://cli.github.com/">GitHub CLI site</a> and click the download button.
1. Run the installation file and follow the prompts. You can accept all the default settings.
</Steps>

### VS Code Extensions

<Image src={VSCode} alt="Extensions Icon" />


Extensions are a great way to improve your productivity and simplify your coding experience. Here are the recommended extensions for this course:

- <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">**Live Server**</a> (by Ritwick Dey)
- <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one">**Markdown All in One**</a> (by Yu Zhang)
- <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf">**Markdown PDF**</a> (by yzane)
- <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid">**Markdown Preview Mermaid Support**</a> (by Matt Bierner)

<Aside type="caution">

Installing extensions is super easy, but be careful not to go overboard. Some extensions can interfere with each other.
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Launch VS Code and click the Extensions icon.
1. Enter the name of the extension you want in the search bar.
1. Click the *Install* button for the extension.
</Steps>

## Updating Your Tools

The programs you install to help you write code will often be updated over time. Some tools get updated frequently (VS Code is a good example, as new versions are published on a monthly basis). VS Code will open a pop-up when a new version is available. All of the other programs typically have their own update process, so you are encouraged to re-visit those sites to see the prescribed process for updating.
