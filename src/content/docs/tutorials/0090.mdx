## A Generic Form

Remember that [Sandbox website](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/sandbox/) that we used to explore JavaScript in an ad-hoc way? Grab a fresh copy of that starter code, because we're going to use it as the foundation to learn about **Event Listeners** in JavaScript.

Oh, and also grab the code related to the `appendLine()` function we created in the [Re-usable Functions](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0060/) tutorial.

### A Simple Calculator

- Edit the HTML to throw in some generic text inputs and buttons
- Programmatically change the labels, etc. of the inputs and the `#instructions` text.
    - Alter input types to `number`
    - have labels of `'Not used'` on unused inputs and set the `disabled` property to true
- Process form input, preventing the default behaviour and doing simple calculations

### Background Color Pickers (and Radio Buttons?)

- Process a color input to change the background of the `output#feedback` element.
