- Define the term "boundary condition" as it relates to if-else statements and testing
  - A "boundary condition" is also known as a "fence-post condition".
  - The "boundary" is the border of a range of values that are regarded as "acceptable" for some variable. For example, if a particular variable named percent is to represent a range of values from zero through 100 inclusive, then the "boundary" values are zero and 100.
  - A boundary condition, then, is a test or comparison that is made against some boundary values. For example,

  ```cs
    if(percent >= 0 && percent <= 100)
    {
        // code to perform if true
    }
    else
    {
        // code to perform if false
    }
  ```

- Identify the correct way to compare or check the contents of strings in conditional expressions
  - The proper way to compare String values is to use the .Equals(), .CompareTo() and .IsNullOrEmpty() methods.
  - Generally, the relational operators (==, <, etc) should not be used directly on string values.
- List and describe the commonly used fields and methods of the String class that would be used in if-else statements
  - `.Equals(String)` - returns a Boolean, true or false, as to whether the two strings are or are not equal.
  - `.Equals(String, StringComparison)` - returns a Boolean, true or false, as to whether the two strings are or are not equal, according to the value of the StringComparison argument (which includes values to ignore any differences in upper and lower case).
  - `.CompareTo(String anotherString)` - compares two strings "lexographically" (that is, alphabetically) and returns either
    1. a zero if they are the same, or
    1. a negative number if anotherString is greater than the first string, or
    1. a positive number if anotherString is less than the first string
  - `.IsNullOrEmpty(string)` - returns true if the string is an empty string (""), false if it is not an empty string.
  - `.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(string)` - (only in .NET 4.0 and higher) returns true if the string is null, an empty string (""), or all "whitespace" (tab, newline) characters; false if it is not.
  - `.Length` - returns the total number of characters in the string.

## Topic G - Raising Exceptions

### General Programming Concepts and Terms

- Describe how object-oriented programs run.
  - A computer program is a set of instructions for manipulating information.
  - Every computer program has a single starting (or entry) point called the Main method. The main method is responsible to "run" (or "execute) the program, and when the main method exits, the program closes and stops "running". The length of time that a program is running is called its "lifetime". As a program runs, it executes instructions in the program's code, one at a time; this is called the "flow of execution".
  - During the lifetime of a program, the main method creates objects and calls methods on those objects. Each method is basically a set of instructions to be executed. Those methods can, in turn, create other objects and call other methods.
  - Whenever a method is called, the operating system keeps track of which method is calling another method through something known as a "call stack".

- Describe what is meant by a "call stack".
  - A call stack is a mechanism to track which method is calling another method while the program is running. Call stacks allow the computer to know where to "return to" when a method exits.
  - At any given point during the program's execution, the method that is currently executing is referred to as the "called method". When the called method exits, it returns control back to the "calling method", thereby allowing the calling method to continue its own execution.
  - Whenever a method calls another method, the "calling method" pauses and waits for the "called method" to finish; once the called method returns, the calling method will resume executing its own code.

- Define the term "Exception"
  - An exception is a message of some run-time error that has occurred in a program. Exceptions interrupt the normal flow of execution in methods, forcing the method to immediately exit. Methods generate exceptions by using the "throw" statement. Any method may generate an exception (including constructors).
  - The throw statement exits the method by sending back an object (called an "Exception Object", or simply an "Exception") that can be used to identify the kind of error that has occurred. The calling method then has the opportunity to deal with (or "handle") the error; if the calling method does not handle the error, then the exception continues to go back through the call stack until it finds a method that will handle the exception.
  - If none of the methods on the call stack handle the exception that was thrown, control is eventually returned to the main method. If the main method does not handle the exception, then the exception is sent to the operating system. At that point, the operating system shuts down the program in what is called an "abnormal program termination".

- Describe what is meant by the phrase "raising (or throwing) an exception"
  - To "raise an exception" (or "throw an exception") is to force a method to exit prematurely by sending back an "Exception object".

- Describe the role that exceptions play in a computer program
  - An exception is an interruption in the normal flow of execution in a method; exceptions force the method to immediately exit.
  - Exceptions provide a way for methods (including constructors) to report errors to whatever code that is calling the method. These errors are usually (but not always) due to invalid information passed into the methods via the parameters. Through the use of exceptions, methods can perform validation on their parameters and report any errors that might prevent the method from being able to perform its task.

- Identify the three most commonly used Exception types used in this course.
  - .NET Framework
    - **ArgumentException** - Typically thrown whenever an argument passed to a parameter does not have an "acceptable" value.
      
      For example, if a method has a parameter called "percent", it might perform validation to ensure that the value is not less than zero or greater than 100. If the value is not valid, it may be appropriate to throw an ArgumentException.
    - **ArgumentNullException** - Typically thrown whenever an object is checked for and found to be "null".

      (ArgumentNullException will be discussed in the topic on Enumerations and Composition.)
    - **Exception** - This represents a general exception, and can be used whenever there is no other suitable exception type.

### OOP Basics

- Explain why methods (including constructors) should perform validation of their parameter values
  - One of the principles of object-oriented design is that objects must be responsible for ensuring that their fields have correct values. This is known as ensuring a "valid state" for an object.
  - Typically, the values that are stored in fields come in through the parameters of a constructor or a method. Because objects are responsible for ensuring a valid state, the class' methods must check all parameters that might allow "invalid" data to be passed in.

- Explain the significance of raising an exception in the constructor
  - If an exception is thrown from a constructor (or passes through it on its way up the call stack), the object's construction is interrupted. Because the construction of that object is interrupted, the object does not get instantiated.

- Use exceptions as part of the validation of parameter values in methods and constructors.
  - Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.

- Explain why property setters are a good place for throwing exceptions.
  - Generally speaking, the only method that should directly modify a field is the property setter associated with the field. Because of this principle, the property setter is the ideal place to perform validation and to throw exceptions. When validation takes place here, it eliminates the need for duplicating the validation elsewhere in the class.
  - Validating input and throwing exceptions from within setters is a good way to follow the ***DRY*** principle: "**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself".

- Identify when constructors should throw exceptions directly.
  - Whenever a field has a property setter that performs validation, the constructor should use that setter to store information in the field. If no property setter is available to process the parameter values sent through the constructor, then the constructor should perform its own validation on those parameters.

## Topic H - Case Structures

#### General Programming Concepts and Terms

- Describe the syntax of the switch statement
  - Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.

- Discuss the limitations of the switch statement in C# and the available alternatives for the times that we can't use a switch statement
  - Switch statements only work with integral data types (such as char and int).
  - The individual case values must be constants; variable expressions are not allowed for the matching cases.
  - Switch statements only check for exact matches (meaning that there is an implied "is-equal-to" comparison); other relational comparisons, such as greater than or less than, are not allowed.
  - When it is not possible to use switch statements, case structures can be written up as nested and/or stacked if-else structures to make use of the if-else statement.

## Topic I Enumerations and Composition

### General Programming Concepts and Terms

- Define the term Enumeration
  - An enumeration is a simple program-defined data type with a limited set of possible values. Enumerations represent information that is "conceptual" in nature (as opposed to information that is textual, numeric, or complex).
  For example, a coin has two sides that are commonly referred to as HEADS and TAILS. Rather than creating two constant strings with the values "Heads" and "Tails" and a String variable called FaceShowing, you can use an enumeration.
  - There are two parts to enumerations:
  a. The name of the enumeration, which is the name of the new data type; this is sometimes referred to as the "enumerated data type".
  b. A set of enumerated values, which represent all of the possible values for a variable of that enumerated type. These values act like "constants" that can be used to distinguish different "states" for the conceptual data.

- List the benefits of using enumerations
  - **Type Safety** - Enumerations allow a program to be "type safe", meaning that there is less likelihood of creating logical errors or other mistakes through the use of constants or literal values.
  - **Code Readability** - Enumerations make code more readable than constants or literal values (like integers).
  - **Compatibility with Switch Statements** - Enumerations are compatible with switch statements, making them a great option for describing distinct values for matching against different cases. Because enumerations are like constants, and are treated as integral data types by the compiler, they are often the best choice when working with case structures.
  - **Useful as Flags** - Because the programmer can associate specific integer values to the enumerated values, it is possible to use an enumerated data type to create complex "flags" for representing distinct "states" that can be combined together.
  For example, if you had an enumerated type such as the following, you could combine two states together in a variable's value to represent distinct but compatible states, such as `ACTIVE` and `MEDIUM_PRIORITY`.

    ```csharp
    enum Status
    {
        INACTIVE = 0
        ACTIVE = 1
        LOW_PRIORITY = 2
        MEDIUM_PRIORITY = 4
        HIGH_PRIORITY = 8
    }
    ```

- Describe where and when enumerations are used
  - Enumerations are used wherever a clearly defined set of values can be "classified" and used to represent conceptual information.
  - Enumerations should be used whenever you might be inclined to use a set of two or more constants to represent distinct "states" or values for comparing against a variable.

    For example, if you want to represent the two sides of a coin, it is better to use an enumeration for the coin's HEADS and TAILS sides, rather than declaring some String or integer constants. The problem with using strings or simple integers to represent possible coin faces is that any variable that is defined as a string or integer can have values that won't match either of the declared constants, as in this example:

    ```csharp
    const string Heads = "Heads";
    const string Tails = "Tails";
    // There is nothing preventing "invalid" values for the following coin face...
    string theFaceShowingOnTheCoin = "Sailboat";
    ```

    An enumerated type called `CoinFace` with the values `HEADS` and `TAILS` is better, because any variable declared of type `CoinFace` can only have the values defined in the enumeration.

    ```csharp
    // The only other possible value that could be assigned is
    // CoinFace.TAILS
    CoinFace theFaceShowingOnTheCoin = CoinFace.HEADS;
    ```

- Compare and contrast enumerations and classes
  - Enumerations and classes both define new data types that can be used by our program to represent custom data. However, while classes are useful in describing complex data types (that is, data types with assorted fields and that can perform various tasks), enumerations are only used to create new data types that are simple in nature. Enumerations only define a set of possible values, and each variable defined by an enumeration can only hold one of those possible values at any given time; there is no inner complexity to enumerations, as there is with classes.

- Use enumerations to define simple data types that are conceptual in nature and that have a limited set of possible "values"
  - Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.

### OOP Basics

- Describe the idea of Composition
  - Composition refers to the situation where one or more of the fields in a class are objects. All classes are capable of having objects as fields, rather than just using the simple primitive types that come with the language.
  For example, if a class called Address represents some mailing address, another class, such as Student, Company, School, or Business, could have a field whose data type is Address.

- List the benefits of Composition
  - Composition is an aspect of modern programming languages that makes it possible to create new data types (classes) of ever increasing complexity.
  - Composition also makes it possible to get better code re-use, because classes can be more distinct, rather than overlapping. For example, both Students and Employees can have Addresses, so it is not necessary to code individual fields in the Student and Employee class for each part of an address; rather, a common type (called Address) can be shared by both classes.

    ```csharp
    public class Employee {
        // ... other fields, followed by these Address fields:
        public string street { get; set; }
        public string city { get; set; }
        public string province { get; set; }
        // ... etc.
    }

    public class Student {
        // ... other fields, followed by these Address fields:
        public string street { get; set; }
        public string city { get; set; }
        public string province { get; set; }
        // ... etc.
    }
    ```

    These could be coded like this:

    ```csharp
    public class Employee {
        // ... other fields, followed by these Address fields:
        public Address mailingAddress { get; set; }
    }

    class Student {
        // ... other fields, followed by these Address fields:
        public Address homeAddress { get; set; }
    }
    ```

  - *advanced benefit* - Composition promotes the "Has-A" approach to designing objects rather than the "Is-A" design approach that makes use of inheritance. This "Has-A" approach gives programmers more flexibility in their coding and promotes the use of Design Patterns.

- List the major benefits of using collections instead of arrays
  - Collections such as `List<T>` can grow in capacity whenever items are added
  - Collections such as `List<T>` do not need special management of the boundaries (such as the index of the upper limit of an array)
  - Collections provide simple methods for quick adding and removing of "elements"

## Topic L - Arrays - Not Sorted

### General Programming Concepts and Terms

- Describe what makes an array different from other collections in C#
  - The programmer is responsible to manage the boundaries of the array when manipulating the array's contents.
  - Arrays do not automatically “re-size” when “adding” or “removing” elements; the size of the array is fixed at the time the array is created.

- Describe the situations in which arrays are preferable over the use of collections
  - Arrays are preferred whenever multi-dimensional data is required (such as 2D, 3D, or n-dimensional data is needed)
  - Arrays are sometimes preferred whenever the size (number of elements) is unlikely to change and/or whenever the array is based on a primitive data type or an enumeration.

## Math + Mermaid

Here is some math:

$$
f(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

```mermaid
graph TD;
    start{Followed issue\ntemplate?}
    start --NO--> close1[Close and ask to\nfollow template]
    start --YES--> dupe{Is duplicate?}
    dupe --YES--> close2[Close and point\nto duplicate]
    dupe --NO--> repro{Has proper\nreproduction?}
    repro --NO--> close3[Label: 'needs reproduction'\nbot will auto close if no update\nhas been made in 3 days]
    repro --YES--> real{Is actually a bug?}
    real --NO--> maybefeat{Is it a feature request?}
    maybefeat -- YES --> roadmap[Close the issue.\n Point user to the roadmap.]
    maybefeat -- NO --> intended{Is the intended\nbehaviour?}
    intended --YES--> explain[Explain and close\npoint to docs if needed]
    intended --NO--> open[Add label 'needs discussion'\nRemove 'needs triage' label]
    real --YES--> real2["1. Remove 'needs triage' label\n2. Add related feature label if\napplicable (e.g. 'feat: ssr')\n3. Add priority and meta labels (see below)"]
    real2 --> tolabel[Use the framework below to decide the priority of the issue,\nand choose the correct label]
