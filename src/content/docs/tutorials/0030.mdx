In this tutorial, we will build a very simple web page so that we can explore using JavaScript to query DOM elements and then change the content (text) of those elements.

## Building the Web Page

<Aside type="tip" title="Your Student Workbook">
Your instructor may direct you to put the code for this tutorial in your student workbook. Create a subfolder to hold the file(s) mentioned below. It's a good idea to also take some notes on what you've learned/discovered in this tutorial. When you're done, commit and push your final solution.
</Aside>


<Steps>

1. First, we need to set up a web page. Create a file called `index.html` and enter the following text:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <title>HTML vs. The DOM</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>HTML vs. The DOM</h1>
       <p>When we write HTML, we create tags (like &lt;p&gt;), add text, and reference images, stylesheets, etc. For example</p>
       <figure>
           <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World-Wide Web&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
       </figure>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

1. View the web page in your browser by launching it with LiveServer. You should see something like this (it might vary a bit, depending on your browser).

   <Image src={htmlPlain} alt="Simple web page, no styling" />

1. Let's use a third-party stylesheet called [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/). Add the following to the `<head>`, just below the `<title>` element.

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet"
         href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css">
   ```

1. Modify the `<body>` tag by adding the CSS class *`container`*.

   ```html
   <body class="container">
   ```

1. When you view it in the browser, it now looks like this.

   <Image src={htmlPico} alt="Web page with PicoCSS" />

   Not terribly different from the plain HTML, but this lesson is about *JavaScript*, not HTML and CSS.
</Steps>


We've created a simple web page with minimal content. If you've done something like this before, then it should feel pretty self-explanatory. It's time to move on to working with JavaScript!

## Exploring the DOM

In this part, we will begin exploring our web page using JavaScript. Specifically, we'll be exploring the `document.querySelector()` function.

<Steps>

1. Return to the browser and view web page you created above. Open the browser's dev tools (press <kbd>F12</kbd>) and select the console.
1. Type the following JavaScript in the console and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1')
   ```

1. You should see the following in the terminal. If you hover your mouse over this result, you should see that the browser highlights the corresponding element in the browser.

   ```html
   <h1>HTML vs. The DOM</h1>
   ```

   <Aside>
   You might think that the JavaScript is simply giving us our HTML, but *it's not*. It's actually referencing the **DOM element**. But because we *stopped* typing code by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, it simply presented that DOM element as a *string* (the HTML you just observed).
   </Aside>

1. Type another line in the console, but **don't press enter**. The code looks just like the previous one, ***but*** notice the dot (`.`) at the end.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1').
   ```

   You should be seeing a *dropdown* of all sorts of items. These are the *members* of that `<h1>` DOM element.

   <Image src={intellisense} alt="Intellisense" />

   <Aside type="tip">
   If the dropdown disappears, simply press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> and re-type the dot (`.`) *or* press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>spacebar</kbd>.
   </Aside>

1. Finish typing out the line with the text `tagName`, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1').tagName
   ```

   You should see the the output `'H1'`.

1. Try it again, but with a different member of the `<h1>` DOM element. Enter the following code in the console.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1').innerText
   ```

   This time, the output should be `HTML vs. The DOM`, but without the `<h1>` open and close tags.

1. Let's look for another element. Enter the following in the console. It should display the HTML for the `<figure>` tag.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('figure')
   ```

1. Lastly, we'll see what the HTML looks like *inside* the `<figure>` element. Enter the following in the console.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('figure').innerHTML
   ```

   You should see the following displayed in the console.

   ```html
   <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World-Wide Web&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
   ```

</Steps>

In our browser, we can use the `document.querySelector()` function in JavaScript to find *HTML Elements* in the web page. Notice how I've used the term "HTML *Elements*" rather than referring to them as "*tags*". That's because our HTML *source code* (what we typed in the `index.html` file) is something different than what the browser *renders* or produces when it shows us that web page. It might be helpful to think of our `index.html` as a *recipe* whereas the thing we see in the web browser is the *result* of following that recipe to create something real you can eat. You can find more information in the document [HTML vs. The DOM].

<Aside type="tip">
We've looked at the `document.querySelector()` method, and we used it by supplying literal string values. These are *selector strings*. In this tutorial, I've been assuming you know what *selectors* are from your prior experience with CSS. For more information on selectors and the other ways we can find DOM elements, see the [Find DOM Elements](/CPSC-1520/guies/0030/) guide.

## Editing the DOM

We observed that we can use `.innerText` to retrieve the text and `.innerHTML`
to retrieve the HTML inside a DOM element. We can also use these properties to *change* the content of DOM elements. It's time to discover how we can edit our document object model.

<Steps>
1. Let's change the text in our `<h1>` element. Type the following inside the browser's console and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1').innerText = 'HTML vs. The Document Object Model'
   ```

   You should see the text change inside the browser. We have *replaced* the original text of the element with something different. In the code we just wrote, the `=` symbol is called the **assignment operator**.
1. This next line of JavaScript will *append* text to what we currently have in the `<h1>` element.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML += ' (DOM)'
   ```

   Notice that this time we used the `+=` operator. This is a slightly different assignment operator that allows us to add text to the end of what is currently in the DOM element.
1. Now, let's add a caption to our sample code. Enter the following in the console.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('figure').innerHTML += '<figcaption>Sample HTML Tag</figcaption>'
   ```

   This time, we didn't just append plain text to our element. Instead, we changed the HTML of that element. Type the following to see what our `<figure>` looks like as HTML.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('figure')
   ```

1. Let's see what happens if we try putting in HTML tags using the `.innerText`. Once again, we'll change the `<h1>` element.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1').innerText = 'I can write <u>JavaScript</u>'
   ```

   What did you see in the browser? Was the word JavaScript underlined?
1. This time, let's use the `.innerHTML` property.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = 'I can write <u>JavaScript</u>'
   ```

1. After observing the effects of running our JavaScript code, **refresh the page** (you can do this by pressing the <kbd>F5</kbd> function key).

   Did you notice how all our changes disappeared? That's because we used JavaScript to change what was in *the browser*, not what was in our `index.html` file! Refreshing the page tells the browser to reload the `index.html`.
</Steps>

You have just discovered how to **programmatically** edit the contents of a web page. This ability to iteract with our web page using JavaScript opens up endless possibilities for all sorts of end-user experiences!

## Challenge: What's Next?

How might you build on this tutorial? Continue exploring the use of the `.querySelector()` function in the HTML page you built. Then go and explore how you can use it in the dev console for *any* web page! Lastly, take a look at the official documentation for the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector" target="_blank">`.querySelector()` method on <Badge text="MDN" size="small" variant="note" /></a>.
