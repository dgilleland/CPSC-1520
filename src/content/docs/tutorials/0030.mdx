In this tutorial, we will build a very simple web page so that we can explore using JavaScript to query DOM elements and then change the content (text) of those elements.

## Building the Web Page

<Aside type="tip" title="Your Student Workbook">
Your instructor may direct you to put the code for this tutorial in your student workbook. Create the subfolder to hold the file(s) mentioned below. It's a good idea to also take some notes on what you've learned/discovered in this tutorial. When you're done, commit and push your final solution.
</Aside>


<Steps>

1. First, we need to set up a web page. Create a file called `index.html` and enter the following text:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <title>HTML vs. The DOM</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>HTML vs. The DOM</h1>
       <p>When we write HTML, we create tags (like &lt;p&gt;), add text, and reference images, stylesheets, etc. For example</p>
       <figure>
           <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World-Wide Web&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
       </figure>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

1. View the web page in your browser by launching it with LiveServer. You should see something like this (it might vary a bit, depending on your browser).

1. Let's use a third-party CSS called PicoCSS. Add the following to the `<head>`, just under the `<title>`.

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet"
         href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css">
   ```

1. Modify the `<body>` tag by adding the CSS class *`container`*.

   ```html
   <body class='container'>
   ```

1. When you view it in the browser, it now looks like this.

We've created a simple web page with minimal content. If you've done something like this before, then it should feel pretty self-explanatory. It's time to move on to working with JavaScript!

## Exploring the DOM

In this part, we will begin exploring our web page using JavaScript. Specifically, we'll be exploring the `document.querySelector()` function.

<Steps>

1. Return to the browser and view web page you created above. Open the browser's dev tools (press <kbd>F12</kbd>) and select the console.
1. Type the following JavaScript in the console and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1')
   ```

1. You should see the following in the terminal. If you hover your mouse over this result, you should see that the browser highlights the corresponding element in the browser.

   ```html
   <h1>HTML vs. The DOM</h1>
   ```

   <Aside>
   You might think that the JavaScript is simply giving us our HTML, but *it's not*. It's actually referencing the **DOM element**. But because we *stopped* typing code by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, it simply presented that DOM element as a *string* (the HTML you just observed).
   </Aside>

1. Type another line in the console, but **don't press enter**. The code looks just like the previous one, ***but*** notice the dot (`.`) at the end.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1').
   ```

   You should be seeing a *dropdown* of all sorts of items. These are the *members* of that `<h1>` DOM element.

   > üìãüñºÔ∏è Image Here

   <Aside type="tip">
   If the dropdown disappears, simply press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> and re-type the dot (`.`) *or* press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>spacebar</kbd>.
   </Aside>

1. Finish typing out the line with the text `nodeName`, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1').tagName
   ```

   You should see the the output `'H1'`.

1. Try it again, but with a different member of the `<h1>` DOM element. Enter the following code in the console.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('h1').innerText
   ```

   This time, the output should be `HTML vs. The DOM`

1. Let's look for another element. Enter the following in the console. It should display the HTML for the `<figure>` tag.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('figure')
   ```

1. Lastly, we'll see what the HTML looks like *inside* the `<figure>` element. Enter the following in the console.

   ```js
   document.querySelector('figure').innerHTML
   ```

   You should see the following displayed in the console.

   ```html
   <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World-Wide Web&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
   ```

</Steps>

In our browser, we can use the `document.querySelector()` function in JavaScript to find *HTML Elements* in the web page. Notice how I've used the term "HTML *Elements*" rather than referring to "*tags*". That's because our HTML *source code* (what we typed in the `index.html` file) is something different than what the browser *renders* or produces when it shows us that web page. It might be helpful to think of our `index.html` as a *recipe* whereas the thing we see in the web browser is the *result* of following that recipe. You can find more information in the document [HTML vs. The DOM].

## Editing the DOM

> TODO:
>
> - Change the `.innerText` to read `HTML vs. The Document Object Model`
> - Change the `<figure>` to have a `<figcaption>`
> - After observing the effects of running our JavaScript code, **refresh the page**. Notice how those changes have disappeared? That's because we used JavaScript to change what was in *the browser*, not what was in our `index.html` file!

## Challenge: What's Next?

How might you build on this tutorial?
