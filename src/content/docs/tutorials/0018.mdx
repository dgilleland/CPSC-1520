Functions are not just first-class objects. They are the basis upon which objects are created in the first place.

In this tutorial, we will discover more about the different types of variables and objects we work with every day in JavaScript. We'll also explore **constructor functions** and **classes** and how they work with the `new` keyword.


<details>
    <summary>Learning Outcome Guide</summary>

    At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

    - Describe the purpose of the prototype in JavaScript.
    - Define a prototype using a constructor function.
    - Define a prototype using a class.
    - Compare and constrast the terms "function" and "method".
    - Design custom prototypes for objects with properties.
    - Design custom prototypes for obejcts with methods.
    - Compare and constrast the use of constructor functions and classes when designing prototypes for custom objects.
</details>

For the setup of this tutorial, launch VS Code side-by-side with an external terminal. Create a JavaScript file called `functions-and-objects.js` and run it in the terminal (`node --watch functions-and-objects.js`).


## Revisiting Data Types

<Steps>
1. Do you remember some of the different data types we created? Strings, numbers, booleans, dates, and objects? We even created functions as objects. And we discovered that we can use the `typeof` keyword to discover what type a particular variable happened to be.

    Add the following code to your file. We'll be using this function to discover more about the variables we are working with in our files.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    const describe = function(variable) {
      console.log(`The value ${variable} is of type ${typeof variable}.`);
    }

    let someVariable; // we'll be re-assigning different values to this
    ```

1. Now, let's assign our first value to `someVariable` and describe what it is.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    someVariable = 'Any Text';
    describe(someVariable);
    ```

    You should see the following in the terminal. Odds are you were able to predict the output before observing it in the terminal.

    ```ps
    The value Any Text is of type string.
    ```

1. Let's add some more code.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    someVariable = 42;
    describe(someVariable);

    someVariable = true;
    describe(someVariable);
    ```

    Now the output of our program looks like this.

    ```ps
    The value Any Text is a string.
    The value 42 is a number.
    The value true is a boolean.
    ```

1. Let's throw another couple of items in the mix. The first is just an object literal. The second is a reference to our function `describe`.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    someVariable = {}; // An empty object literal
    describe(someVariable);

    someVariable = describe; // This is getting very Meta...
    describe(someVariable);
    ```

    These lines add the following output in our terminal.

    ```ps
    The value [object Object] is a object.
    The value function (variable) {
      console.log(`The value ${variable} is of type ${typeof variable}.`);
    } is a function.
    ```

    Each time, the template string that we log to the console takes the placeholder `${variable}` and calls its `.toString()` to get the text representation of whatever value is inside. For any generic object, its default `.toString()` produces `[object Object]`. Make note of that distinction.

    Also note that for any function we create, its `.toString()` will display the *function declaration* with the code implementation.

1. Let's try assigning another function to `someVariable`.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    someVariable = console.log;
    describe(someVariable);
    ```

    These lines add the following output in our terminal.

    ```ps
    The value function () { [native code] } is of type function.
    ```

    The JavaScript engine is rather protective of what code lays inside of the built-in functions. And that makes sense, at least from a security perspective.

1. Let's try one more value for `someVariable`. This time, we'll create an instance of a date.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    someVariable = new Date('March 5, 2024');
    describe(someVariable);
    ```

    The interesting thing to note in the display is what the data type is for our `new Date()`: **`object`**.

    ```ps "object"
    The value Tue Mar 05 2024 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time) is of type object.
    ```

1. As we close out this part of the tutorial, let's make a change to the `describe()` function.

    ```diff lang="js" title="functions-and-objects.js" ".constructor.name"
      const describe = function (variable) {
        console.log(`The value ${variable} is of type ${typeof variable}.`);
    +   let className = variable.constructor.name;
    +   console.log(`The variable is based on the ${className} prototype.\n`)
      };
    ```

    Underneath all values - primitive or complex - lays some **prototype** that is used to construct or build the value.

    ```ps "String" "Number" "Boolean" "Object" "Function" "Date"
    The value Any text is of type string.
    The variable is based on the String prototype.

    The value 42 is of type number.
    The variable is based on the Number prototype.

    The value true is of type boolean.
    The variable is based on the Boolean prototype.

    The value [object Object] is of type object.
    The variable is based on the Object prototype.

    The value function (variable) {
      console.log(`The value ${variable} is of type ${typeof variable}.`);
      let className = variable.constructor.name;
      console.log(`The variable is based on the ${className} prototype.\n`);
    } is of type function.
    The variable is based on the Function prototype.

    The value function () { [native code] } is of type function.
    The variable is based on the Function prototype.

    The value Tue Mar 05 2024 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time) is of type object.
    The variable is based on the Date prototype.
    ```
</Steps>

Even ordinary variables are, in some fashion, objects. The distinction between primitive and complex types still exists (and you can read more about it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures" target="_blank">here</a>). But the key takeaway you should make is that somewhere under the surface is this thing called a **Prototype** that works to define what an object *looks like* (its data-holding properties) and how it *behaves* (its functions or *methods*).

## Constructor Functions

Merriam-Webster defines a "prototype" as *"an original model on which something is patterned"* (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prototype" target="_blank">source</a>). In JavaScript, these prototypes are declared using **Constructor Functions**.

A constructor function is declared like any other function (with *function declaration* or *function expression* syntax). What's different is on the *inside* (the code in the curly braces) and how it's *called* (using the `new` keyword). Let's explore.

<Steps>
1. Imagine we wanted to create objects that represented *cars* (at least, in the virtual sense). We would start by building a *prototype* using a constructor function.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    const Car = function(vin, color, odometer) {
        // Coming soon...
    }
    ```

    You might notice that we declared our function using a capital `C`. It's common practice to start constructor functions with a capital letter. This is a standard way to help distinguish a constructor function from any other function. We've already seen this in regard to the `Date()` function; `Date()` is a constructor function. (See [naming guidelines](TODO: add reference link).)
1. The way we use the constructor function is to prefix the call with the `new` keyword. This should look very similar to how we created `Date()` objects earlier. Let's build a car!

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js" "new"
    let myFirstCar = new Car('WAUWFAFL9CA035531', 'green', 42);
    //                        \_/\___/|||\____/
    //                         |   |  |||  |- Serial Number
    //                         |   |  |||- Plant
    //                         |   |  ||- Model Year
    //                         |   |  |- Check Digit
    //                         |   |- Vehicle Descriptor Section (VDS)
    //                         |- World Manufacturer Identifier (WMI)
    describe(myFirstCar);
    ```

    Our terminal shows a description of the object. Notice how the name of the constructor function is identified as the object's prototype.

    ```ps "Car"
    The value [object Object] is of type object.
    The variable is based on the Car prototype.
    ```

1. The `describe()` function uses a template string to display the variable. Let's tweak that function to get a better sense of the data in our objects.

    ```diff lang="js" title="functions-and-objects.js"
      const describe = function (variable) {
    -   console.log(`The value ${variable} is of type ${typeof variable}.`);
    +   console.log("The value is:\n", variable);
        let className = variable.constructor.name;
    -   console.log(`The variable is based on the ${className} prototype.\n`);
    +   console.log(`The variable is of type ${typeof variable} and is based on the ${className} prototype.\n`);
      };
    ```

    The output is a little better. Now, instead of seeing the variable's value as a `.toString()` representation (which is what happens in template strings), we get to see the actual contents of our object.

    ```ps "Car {}"
    The value is:
      Car {}
    The variable is of type object and is based on the Car prototype.
    ```

1. The parameters of constructor functions are used to supply data that the object can store in its **properties**. A special keyword is used so that the data is associated with the *instance* of the object. Let's modify our `Car` prototype.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    const Car = function(vin, color, odometer) {
        this.vin = vin;
        this.color = color;
        this.odometerReading = odometer;
    }
    ```

    Now we can see how our object has retained the data sent in through the parameter list. By storing those parameter values in `this` object, each one becomes a property of the object. We could, for example, access `myFirstCar.odometerReading` to focus on just the mileage this car has.
    
    ```ps "Car {}"
    The value is:
      Car { vin: 'WAUWFAFL9CA035531', color: 'green', odometerReading: 42 }
    The variable is of type object and is based on the Car prototype.
    ```

    <Aside type="tip" title="What's Up With `this`?">
      To understand `this`, you need to understand what's `new`.
      
      The `new` keyword tells the JavaScript engine to set aside memory for a brand new object. In order to do that, there needs to be some memory location in which to store that object. Remember, the entire expression has to be evaluated *before* the assignment to our variable `myFirstCar`. So the JavaScript engine needs to keep track of the new object somehow, and it uses the `this` keyword for just that purpose.

      For a more visual description of what's going on with `this`, see the [ARTICLE_NAME][TODO: Write this].
    </Aside>

1. Objects aren't restricted to just properties. We can add **methods** to our objects, giving them newfound capabilities. Let's deck out our car some more.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    const Car = function(vin, color, odometer) {
        // Properties
        this.vin = vin;
        this.color = color;
        this.odometerReading = odometer;

        // Methods
        this.drive = function(distance) {
          this.odometerReading += distance;
        }
    }
    ```

    A **method** is simply another name for a function that is a *member* of some object. Here's what our output looks like.

    ```ps
    The value is:
     Car {
      vin: 'WAUWFAFL9CA035531',
      color: 'green',
      odometerReading: 42,
      drive: [Function (anonymous)]
    }
    The variable is of type object and is based on the Car prototype.
    ```

1. Let's play with the car, and then make another one.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    myFirstCar.drive(75293);
    console.log(`I sold my first car when it hit ${myFirstCar.odometerReading} km.`);
    let myDreamCar = new Car('4USCH7333WDWC2JH3', 'silver', 1000);
    console.log(`I bought my dream car with ${myDreamCar.odometerReading} kliks.`);
    ```

    What's key to note is that each car is a **separate object** having its own distinct properties. This can be clearly seen in our output.

    ```ps
    I sold my first car when it hit 75335 km.
    I bought my dream car with 1000 kliks.
    ```

</Steps>

Constructor functions have been the way we create prototypes since the very early days of JavaScript. They are not without their limitations, however. One such limitation is that constructor functions are indistinguishable from other functions (other than the practice of naming constructor functions with an initial capital letter). This is a problem only in that it's just too easy to *forget* to use the `new` keyword. Consider this example, using our `Car` constructor function.

```js title="oops! Forgot the new keyword"
let anotherCar = Car('1G1125S39FU147409', 'silver', 12594);
console.log(anotherCar);
```

The value of `anotherCar` is `undefined`, and the reason is simply that we forgot to use the `new` keyword. There is nothing special in the syntax of declaring functions that would capture whether or not the `new` keyword is necessary for our situation.

The solution to this particular dilemma, however, already exists: **Classes**

{/* Author TODO: Re-work or abandon this transition...

There are several helpful characteristics of how object creation (and *inheritance*) works in JavaScript compared to other languages such as C#. One thing is for certain, however. The popularity of other Object Oriented languages like Java and C# have had a definite effect on JavaScript's evolution. This is most evident in the emergence of the `class` keyword in JavaScript.

*/}


## Classes

To make JavaScript coding more palatable for developers with backgrounds in other <abbr title="Object-Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> languages, a new keyword and grammar was added. The `class` was added as an alternate way to describe object prototypes. 

> *"Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain">prototypes</a> but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes."*
>
> <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">Classes</a> on MDN

<Steps>
1. To define a prototype using classes in JavaScript, use the `class` keyword followed by a set of curly braces.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    const BankAccount = class {
        constructor (accountNumber, openingBalance) {
            this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
            this.balance = openingBalance;
        }
    }
    ```

    The curly braces contain the contents of the class. A special function called the `constructor` is invoked when creating a new object based on the class. `constructor` is a keyword.

    <Aside type="tip" title="Use Class Expressions and Constants">
      This `BankAccount` class is declared using a **class expression** syntax. There's also the **class *declaration*** syntax available for us to use.

      ```js
      // Using Class Declaration syntax
      class BankAccount {
        constructor (accountNumber, openingBalance) {
            this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
            this.balance = openingBalance;
        }
      }
      ```

      These two options - *expression* syntax vs. *declaration* syntax - exists for defining functions as well as classes. I've opted for **class expression** syntax for the same reason I define functions using *function expressions* and constants: It eliminates the potential for the class name being re-defined as something else. If I used a *class declaration*, the class could be renamed - `BankAccount = 'Savings';`.
    </Aside>

1. Using the class to create your object is done exactly the same way you would if the prototype was defined with a constructor function.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    let myAccount = new BankAccount("00202-899-123-4567", 500);
    describe(myAccount);
    ```

    The output when we display our object is also the same. Remember, ***class syntax** in JavaScript is simply a modern alternative way to define object prototypes*.

    ```ps
    The value is:
     BankAccount { accountNumber: '00202-899-123-4567', balance: 500 }
    The variable is of type object and is based on the BankAccount prototype.
    ```

1. If we want to define a method in our class, the syntax looks similar to using the constructor. The only difference is that while `constructor` is a keyword, the names we use for our methods can be anything we want. Make the following change to your `BankAccount` class.

    ```diff lang="js" title="functions-and-objects.js"
      const BankAccount = class {
          constructor (accountNumber, openingBalance) {
              this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
              this.balance = openingBalance;
          }
      
    +     deposit(amount) {
    +       this.balance += amount;
    +     }
      }
    ```

    Notice that there is no use of the `function` keyword when declaring class methods. Instead, you simply declare the method name, the parameter list, and a body for the method.
1. With this method in place, we can add money to our bank account.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    myAccount.deposit(77.50);
    console.log(`I made a deposit. My new balance is $ ${myAccount.balance.toFixed(2)}`);
    ```

    Notice that I used the `.toFixed()` function; that's because the property `balance` is a number, and I want the string output to definitely have two digits for the cents portion. The output would be as follows:

    ```ps
    I made a deposit. My new balance is $ 577.50
    ```

1. By using classes as the way to define our prototypes, we also avoid the problem of potentially forgetting the use of the `new` keyword. That's because JavaScript will complain if it's missing. Try adding this code.

    ```js title="functions-and-objects.js"
    // missing the new keyword
    let secondAccount = BankAccount("00202-904-273-8923", 500);
    ```

    You should get the error message "Class constructor BankAccount cannot be invoked without 'new'".

    Remove that code.

    ```diff lang="js" title="functions-and-objects.js"
    - // missing the new keyword
    - let secondAccount = BankAccount("00202-904-273-8923", 500);
    ```

</Steps>

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've established the basics of object design. This just touches the surface of making your own types of objects in JavaScript. Prototypes can be created using constructor functions or classes, but the modern and preferred way these days is to use classes.

### Where to go from here?

At this point, you've got enough of a foundation in JavaScript to head out in a number of different directions. You can explore how [flow control statements](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0001/#flow-control-statements) allow us to perform repetitive tasks and choose between alternate paths of logic. Or, you can take a look at how to set up [JavaScript projects](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0001/#javascript-projects) to build programs using modules and test-driven development (TDD) best practices.


By far, the most natural next step is to **explore using JavaScript in HTML**. We'll begin that soon with the tutorial on [Querying the DOM](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0030/). First, it can be helpful to know how to create your HTML/CSS quickly by learning how to use [*Emmet*](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0025/) in the next tutorial. This will allow you to venture on your own experiments by creating the *content* and *context* for exploring JavaScript in ways that interest you.
