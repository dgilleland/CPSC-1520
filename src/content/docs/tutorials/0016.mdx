    ```js title="app.js"
    // Primitive types: string, number, boolean
    // Complex types: Objects - object literals (the (still popular) OG approach to creating objects)
    // Dynamic Types - A variable's type is determined by the contents of the variable
    // Complex types: Date
    // - Notice how this starts with a capital - that's no mistake. It's a standard for something called Constructor Functions.
    // Global objects in the runtime environment
    // - Node's process object - `process.argv`
    // - Comment on the browser's document obect (next tutorial)
    ```

## Conclusion

With this last tutorial in our JavaScript QuickStart series, we've covered some essential ground that will help us as we move forward.

<Aside type="tip">
We've used Node to run and watch our editing of some simple JavaScript files. Node can also be launched by itself as a stand-alone REPL environment. To learn how to use REPLs for exploring JavaScript, see the [Exploring JavaScript](/CPSC-1520/guides/0010/) guide.

In the next tutorial, we'll take a very brief look HTML and CSS to discover how the browser uses these files to generate (*render*) a web page. In it, we'll discover the amazing connectoin between the web page and JavaScript - one that's at the heart of how browsers operate.
