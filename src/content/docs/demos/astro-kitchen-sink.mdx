import { Aside, Badge, Card, CardGrid, Code, FileTree, Icon, LinkButton, LinkCard, Steps, TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

## Concepts

- [ ] Deploy-First Development: Create an empty Astro site and deploy it to Netlify.
- [ ] SSR-Ready: You can do server-side processing on your Netlify-hosted site with vanilla JavaScript.
- [ ] Content Collections: A couple of examples of Markdown, JSON, YAML, and TOML collections (uses <a href="#" target="_blank">`glob()` loaders</a>)
