An excellent exercise is creating a calendar in JavaScript. Apart from the styling, it gives you a chance to practice looping and user-interactions such as changing the month and selecting a date or date range.

## Rendering a Calendar

Calendars are a great example for rendering a tabular layout. First of all, the data is intrinsic to the problem - no need to store or retrieve sample data from some database or JSON endpoint. Just use your language's built-in Date object and you're good to go.

Secondly, you have a variety of options for how you want to render the calendar. You can use the tried-and-true HTML `<table>`, or you can apply a grid-like layout using simple `<div>` elements and CSS styles.

You also have choices for the content: The traditional monthly calendar shows all the days of the week (Sunday through Saturday). An alternative is to display a work-week calendar (Monday through Friday). You don't have to limit yourself to a single month. Full-year calendars as well as two-, three-, or four-month calendars are also popular choices. If you want to go the extra mile, you can include a column that shows the week of the year.

Your calendar can just include the dates themselves, or you can add scheduled items on the calendar. Multiple items can fit in a single day, or a single item can span multiple days.

Do you want to try something more avant-garde yet compact? Consider how GitHub denotes a calendar on the user's profile for their commit history.

### Sizing for Months

One of the interesting aspects of creating a calendar is how you have to account for the number of weeks you will need when rendering the whole month. Most of the time, you need five weeks, but occassionally you will need only four weeks or as many as six weeks, as shown in this comparison.

| Short Month | Normal Month | Long Month |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:----------:|
| <Image src={short} alt="Short Month" /> | <Image src={normal} alt="Normal Month" /> | <Image src={long} alt="Long Month" /> |

<Aside title="Good Times">
It turns out that there are some *excellent* months for testing your calendar layout calculations, and they coincide with when this demo was published!

The months of Nov 2025 through Mar 2026 are just right for testing.

- Feb 2026 has only four weeks, while Nov 2025 has six. All the rest have the standard five week calendars.
- Dec 2025 starts on a Monday and ends on a Wednesday, making it a good check for calendar days before and after that month.
- Jan 2026 ends on a Saturday - the perfect ending for the last day on a calendar. Meanwhile, there are some dates from the preceding month that can be included as well.
- Mar 2026 starts on a Sunday - the perfect beginning for the first day on a calendar. And with 31 days in March, you are left with extra dates to show for the upcoming month.

### Algorithms

Let's say you've settled on a standard single-month calendar showing all 7 days of the week. The simplest way to render out each "cell" in a tabular layout would be to loop through the days from Sunday to Saturday for each week. You've got some challenges to address.

- How do you get the first and last day of the month if all you have is the year and the month?
- How do you determine what day is the first day of the calendar? It can easily be a date in the *previous* month?
- What about the last day of the calendar? If the last day of the month isn's a Saturday, then you need to consider which dates of the *following* month you need to include.

All of this is solvable with math. And there is more than one way to approach it. Here's an approach in JavaScript.

```js
// Assuming an <input type="month" /> in a 'change' event listener ...
let selectedMonth = evt.target.value; // Format is yyyy-MM
// destructuring an array of values
let [year, month] = selectedMonth.split('-')
//                  \__ string__/\_string[]_/
    .map(text => parseInt(text));
//  \___ number[] _____________/


let startOfMonth = new Date(year, month - 1);
let endOfMonth = new Date(year, month, 0);
let daysDiff = endOfMonth.getDate() + startOfMonth.getDay();
// maxDays will be a multiple of 7, for a full week calendar
let maxDays = daysDiff == 28 ? 28 : daysDiff <= 35 ? 35 : 42;
```

We'll assume we're using simple `<div>` containers for each date, with styling that produces the tabular layout.

```js
function buildDaySlot(date) {
    let div = document.createElement('div');
    let span = document.createElement('span');
    let textNode = document.createTextNode(date.getDate());
    div.appendChild(span);
    span.appendChild(textNode);
    return div;
}
```

```css
#calendar {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr);
    gap: 0;
    width: calc(75px * 7);
}

#calendar > div {
    width: 75px;
    height: 75px;
    border: solid thin gainsboro;
}
```

Then, we can loop through each day for the calendar to render the cell.

```js
// Reset the date to the first day of the week (Sunday),
// so that we can begin noting the actual dates beginning
// with Sunday.
startOfMonth.setDate(startOfMonth.getDate() - startOfMonth.getDay());

for(let count = 0; count < maxDays; count++) {
    calendarContainer.appendChild(buildDaySlot(startOfMonth));    
    startOfMonth.setDate(startOfMonth.getDate() + 1);
}
```
