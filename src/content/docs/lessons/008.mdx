> This is a continuation of the `008/` suite of demos that focus on **Event Handlers** of all sorts, including ***Form `'submit'` events***.

<Aside type="danger" title="Skip `demo-events`">
    The `demo-events` sample includes the `<dialog>` sample, which is **too close to Lab 3**.
</Aside>

## Demo Text Manipulation

Quickly do the standard setup in `~/src/008/demo-text-manipulation` by running **`pnpm i`**. Then launch with `pnpm dev`.

<Steps>
1. Comment on **global variables**:

    Generally, you want to *avoid* global variables, especially if those are being referenced inside of functions. Variables should be **scoped** so that they are accessible within a certain context.
1. This demo focuses on simple **`'click'` event** listeners for buttons and on **text transformations** (string functions).
</Steps>

## âœ¨ Form Processing

Quickly do the standard setup in `~/src/008/form-processing` by running **`pnpm i`**. Then launch with `pnpm dev`.

The **ReadMe.md** has useful commentary that students should review. This demo has *two* forms on the same page: `id='subscribe'` and `id='assorted'`. They have separate event handlers.

### Walk-through

<Steps>
1. Try the first `subscribe` form. Note the built-in browser validation when using `required`.
1. Presume "good" input when filling out the form. (Happy Path ðŸ˜ƒ)
1. Inside the listener, add `console.log()` for

    - `theForm` (variable name can be whatever we want)
    - `theForm.elements`
1. Try the next `assorted` form. Note the absence of any browser validation.
1. Inside the listener, add `console.log()` for

    - `target` (variable name can be whatever we want)
    - `theInputs`
1. Students can ignore the following line from the sample, but it does hint at a ***deeper truth*** about how objects and their properties/methods exist in JavaScript. ðŸ¤”

    ```js
    console['log']("Isn't that cool?!");
    ```
</Steps>

### Key Takeaways

<Steps>
1. Emphasizes the importance of stopping the default behaviour of **form submission** as the *first* thing to do for our client-side processing.

    ```js
    const handleFormSubmit = function(evt) {
        evt.preventDefault(); // Do this first!
    }
    ```

    The normal course of a *real-world* application would actually send form input to the **back end** (i.e.: the *web server*) for processing. We're doing **client-side** processing for *simplicity* and *demonstration purposes* only.
1. Accessing input controls should be done through the form's `.elements` collection. The best practice is to **use the `evt.target` to identify the form** and then move forward from that context.

    Why? Because it helps your event handler function to be more **self-contained**.
1. When the `name` of a user input control has a hypen (e.g.: `first-name`), we use **indexers** instead of property names on the form's `.elements` collection
1. **Comment:** Key attributes of `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<output>` are
    - **`name`** - critical for the whole name/value association when sending data to the back end
    - **`id`** - important when associating a `<label>` to a user input control via the label's `for` attribute
1. Illustrates the various types of input controls (`<input type="...">`):

    - Plain text: `text` (default), `email`
    - Numeric: `number`
    - `checkbox` and `radio` (and the importance of sharing the `name` attribute value)
    - Others: `color`, `date`, `time`
1. Input controls support attributes that provide *limited* validation, such as `required`.

    âœ¨ We're going to pretend the user gives good input at this stage. Soon, we will cover `if/else` and validation of user input.
1. Button types:

    - Using `<input>` with type = `'button'`, `'submit'` (the default), or `reset`
    - Using `<button>`, with the same types as used for an input
</Steps>

- x hours/weeks at $/hour
- base starting rate - $1,000
- y digital assets at $10 each
- content authoring at $0.25/word for 1000 words (or less)
- scheduled start date
- `<output>` elements to hold 
    - the calculated price
    - the estimated start date

Principles

- Keep the handler function (event listener) **self-contained**
    - Leverage `event.target` to get the form, and then the target's `.elements` collection.
