## Port In Use

This has happened to me a couple of times. When running some node application that launches the browser (in my case, `vitest --ui`), I ran into a problem where the port that the Node application was trying to use was already in use.

```ps
EACCES: permission denied ::1:51204
```

I'm running Windows 11, so if I want to see what ports are reserved/in use, I can run the following in the terminal.

```ps
netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp
```

Sure enough, port `51204` was in the range of excluded ports. I'm not sure why, but for some reason this happens every blue moon....

The fix is pretty easy. Open a terminal *in Administrator mode* and run the following:

```ps Administrator Mode
net stop winnat
net start winnat
```
