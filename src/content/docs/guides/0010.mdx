There are several ways to begin exploring JavaScript. You can create simple "sandbox" websites to hold your JavaScript code. You can also use REPLs such as the browser's Developer Tools or the Node REPL within a terminal window.

## REPLs

The term REPL is an acronym for *Read-Eval-Print-Loop*. It refers to an environment where you can write code that gets executed immediately upon pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. REPLs are not considered *production environments*. Rather, they are *"sandbox" environments* where developers can explore and play with the language.

As such, REPLs are great for learning small, targeted aspects of a programming languge. This is particularly helpful when you are new to the language.

In the world of JavaScript, the *Console* tab in the browser's Developer Tools is the most common REPL. Besides being able to write JavaScript, you can explore its use with regard to any web page content (which is why we typically need/want JavaScript code).

Another REPL environment is the Node CLI. Node is a JavaScript run-time environment (suitable for production use), but when you type `node` by itself in a terminal window, you enter a REPL session where you can explore JavaScript free from any browser. The advantage with a Node REPL is a distraction-free JavaScript playground where you can focus on the language itself.

<Aside type="tip">
Both Node and the browser Dev Tools offer a large suite of functions and objects that we regularly use in JavaScript, such as `Date`, `Array`, `JSON`, `Crypto`, etc. These are part of the "global" object that these JS environments provide. In the browser dev tools, the `window` is the global object while in Node it's the `global` object.

Which do you choose? Either one works well. If you need to play with the DOM, then the browser's Dev Tools is the way to go. If you want to just have a JavaScript-only experience, Node is a good choice.

## Ad-hoc Sandbox Pages

import Sandbox from '../tutorials/sandbox.mdx';

Here's some resources you can use for a stand-along web page to act as a "sandbox" for exploring JavaScript. You can also find this sandbox as part of the [related tutorial](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0050/) that introduces some basic JavaScript concepts.
