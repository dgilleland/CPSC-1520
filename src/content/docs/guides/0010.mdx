There are several ways to begin exploring JavaScript. You can create simple "sandbox" websites to hold your JavaScript code. Alternatively, if you don't need a web page's DOM, you can run and watch a JavaScript file directly within a terminal using the `node --watch [filename]` command.

This guide discusses another approach. You can use **REPLs** such as the browser's Developer Tools or the Node REPL within a terminal window.

## REPLs

The term **REPL** is an acronym for *Read-Eval-Print-Loop*. It refers to an environment where you can write code that gets executed immediately upon pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. REPLs are not considered *production environments*. Rather, they are *"sandbox" environments* where developers can explore and play with the language.

As such, REPLs are great for learning small, targeted aspects of a programming languge. This is particularly helpful when you are new to the language.

<Aside type="caution">
  Be aware that a REPL environment - by definition - is ***not*** the same as creating JavaScript files to run in your website. REPLs will
  
  - Give immediate feedback as you are typing code and when you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. 
  - Process *expressions* as well as complete *statements*.
</Aside>

In the world of JavaScript, the *Console* tab in the browser's Developer Tools is the most common REPL. Besides being able to write JavaScript, you can explore its use with regard to any web page content (which is why we typically need/want JavaScript code).

Another REPL environment is the Node CLI. Node is a JavaScript run-time environment (suitable for production use), but when you type `node` by itself in a terminal window, you enter a REPL session where you can explore JavaScript free from any browser. The advantage with a Node REPL is a distraction-free JavaScript playground where you can focus on the language itself.

<Aside type="tip">
Both Node and the browser Dev Tools offer a large suite of functions and objects that we regularly use in JavaScript, such as `Date`, `Array`, `JSON`, `Crypto`, etc. These are part of the "global" object that these JS environments provide. In the browser dev tools, the `window` is the global object while in Node it's the `global` object.
</Aside>

Which do you choose? Either one works well. If you need to play with the DOM, then the browser's Dev Tools is the way to go. If you want to just have a JavaScript-only experience, Node is a good choice.


### Using the Dev Tools Console

import console from './0010/dev-tools-console.png';
import dock from './0010/dev-tools-dock-location.png';
import sources from './0010/dev-tools-sources.png';

Here's how you can access your browser's Developer Tools.

<Steps>
1. In the Edge, Chrome and Firefox browsers, you can toggle the developer tools by pressing the <kbd>F12</kbd> key.
1. You can choose where to dock the dev tools by clicking on the elipsis (&ellip;) on the toolbar.

1. Click on the *"Console"* tab. This will give you a dedicated REPL with which to perform live edits of your page using JavaScript.

1. To view the actual script file(s) the browser has loaded, click on the *"Sources"* tab. Find and click on your JavaScript file from the navigator portion to see the source code for that file.

    <Image src={sources} alt="Sources tab"/>

    Within the Sources tab, you can set breakpoints to control execution of your code and then step through each line as part of your debugging efforts.

    Pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key while in the Sources tab will toggle a Console REPL just below the source code.
</Steps>

Many of the major browsers share the same underlying engine (*Chromium*), so your experience with the developer tools in each will be mostly identical.

    I quickly switched to Google Chrome back in 2008 largely because of the **comic book**. It's definitely worth the read, *especially* once you get into "real world" software development.

### Using Node

Entering the Node REPL is fairly straight forward.

<Steps>
1. Open a terminal window on your computer.
1. Type `node` to enter the Node REPL.
1. Type `.help` for a list of the REPL commands, such as saving and loading external script files.
1. Type `.exit` in the REPL when you want to return to your terminal context.
</Steps>

## Ad-hoc Sandbox Pages

import Sandbox from '../tutorials/sandbox.mdx';

One of the distinguishing aspects of writing actual JavaScript files for a web page is that your code needs to contain complete statements. This is different from a REPL environment because the REPL will process *partial* as well as complete statements. The REPL also automatically gives you feedback on the result of what you are typing. This is different from the "real world" of JavaScript where *you* have to decide what (if anything) is worth displaying on the web page.

Here's some resources you can use for a stand-along web page to act as a "sandbox" for exploring JavaScript. You can also find this sandbox as part of the [related tutorial](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0050/) that introduces some basic JavaScript concepts.
