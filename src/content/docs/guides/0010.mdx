There are several ways to begin exploring JavaScript.

You can create simple "sandbox" websites to run your JavaScript code and then print to the Dev Tool's console. Or, if you don't need any DOM elements, you can just create a plain JS file and use `node --watch` to see what happens as you code. Alternatively, if you don't need a web page's DOM, you can run and watch a JavaScript file directly within a terminal using the `node --watch [filename]` command.

There's another approach if you just want to focus on one-off experiments with JavaScript. You can use **REPLs** such as the browser's Developer Tools Console or the Node REPL within a terminal window.

## Using `node --watch`

This approach is *really handy* if you want to focus on just JavaScript without the distraction of having to build or use a web page with a fully-available *DOM*. In fact, it's the way I start my *QuickStart* tutorials for **beginner programmers**. Exploring JavaScript without having to think about HTML and CSS is very instructive. I like it because it de-clutters the landscape, keeping things simple.

<Aside title="Did you do the setup?">
    You'll need to have Node and Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. You should also be able to launch a separate terminal window so that you can see your code and the results side-by-side.
</Aside>

Use Node to watch your `*.js` script if you want to test-drive working code, particularly when it comes to wrestling with *logic and problem solving*.

<Steps>
1. Launch Visual Studio Code (*VS Code*). From the menubar, select *File -> Open Folder...* and create an empty folder for this quickstart. You can name the folder anything you want, but if you want a suggestion, call it `JS-Quickstart`.
1. Open a separate terminal by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>. Because you did this from within VS Code, the path in the terminal should match the folder you've just opened.

    <Aside title="Windows or Mac?">
    Are you running Windows or Mac for your operating system? These tutorials will work with both, but the screenshots I give are based on Windows 11. If your terminals look a bit different because you're on a Mac, don't worry - the effect of the code will be the same. 
    </Aside>

1. Position the terminal and VS Code side-by-side, so that you can observe what happens as you continue this tutorial.

    <Image src={sideBySide} alt="Terminal and VS Code - Side by Side"/>

1. In VS Code, choose *File -> New File...* and name it `app.js`. Save it in the folder you've just created. This is a JavaScript file, as noted by the file extension `.js`.
1. Type the following code in the file.

    ```js title="app.js"
    console.log('Hello World!');
    ```

1. Switch to the terminal, and run the following command. This will run your `app.js` file in Node and re-run it every time we save changes.

    ```ps title="Terminal Window"
    node --watch app.js
    ```

    You should see the message "Hello World" in the terminal.
</Steps>

Do you want to practice the process of using `node --watch`? Expand the following section and type in more code for the `app.js` file.

  message = `Changing quantity to ${quantity} does not cause previous calculations to re-calculate.\nTotal is still ${total} and amount is still ${amount}.`;
  console.log(message);
  console.log();

  let adjacent = 4;

  console.log(message);

  // - [x] Rounding Errors
  let floating = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1; // What's the answer?
  console.log(`0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 = ${floating}`);
  console.log(`I can round with the Math library: floating should be ${Math.round(floating * 10) / 10}`);

  // - [x] Declaring functions
  function roundToDecimals(num, decimals) {
      let factor = Math.pow(10, decimals);
      return Math.round(num * factor) / factor;
  }

  let num = 3.14159;
  let rounded = roundToDecimals(num, 2); // 3.14
  console.log(`${num} rounded to two decimals: ${rounded}`);
  console.log(`${Math.PI} rounded to seven decimals: ${roundToDecimals(Math.PI, 7)}`);
  ```

## Ad-Hoc Website

- Drop `console.log()` calls into your JavaScript file wherever you need to see what's happening. This is also a favorite technique for **debugging** your code on an ad-hoc basis.
- Build an ultra-simple website with some DOM element that you can write to using its `.innerText` or `.innerHTML` properties.

## REPLs

The term **REPL** is an acronym for *Read-Eval-Print-Loop*. It refers to an environment where you can write code that gets executed immediately upon pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. REPLs are not considered *production environments*. Rather, they are *"sandbox" environments* where developers can explore and play with the language. REPLs will process *expressions* as well as complete *statements* in JavaScript.

<Image src={toy} alt="REPLs Are Sandboxes for Playing with JavaScript" />


As such, REPLs are great for learning small, targeted aspects of a programming languge. This is particularly helpful when you are new to the language.

<Aside type="caution">
  Be aware that a REPL environment - by definition - is ***not*** the same as creating JavaScript files to run in your website. REPLs will
  
  - Give immediate feedback as you are typing code and when you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. 
  - Process *expressions* as well as complete *statements*.
</Aside>

In the world of JavaScript, the *Console* tab in the browser's Developer Tools is the most common REPL. Besides being able to write JavaScript, you can explore its use with regard to any web page content (which is why we typically need/want JavaScript code).

Another REPL environment is the Node CLI. Node is a JavaScript run-time environment (suitable for production use), but when you type `node` by itself in a terminal window, you enter a REPL session where you can explore JavaScript free from any browser. The advantage with a Node REPL is a distraction-free JavaScript playground where you can focus on the language itself.

<Aside type="tip">
Both Node and the browser Dev Tools offer a large suite of functions and objects that we regularly use in JavaScript, such as `Date`, `Array`, `JSON`, `Crypto`, etc. These are part of the "global" object that these JS environments provide. In the browser dev tools, the `window` is the global object while in Node it's the `global` object.
</Aside>

Which do you choose? Either one works well. If you need to play with the DOM, then the browser's Dev Tools is the way to go. If you want to just have a JavaScript-only experience, Node is a good choice.


### Using the Dev Tools Console

import console from './0010/dev-tools-console.png';
import dock from './0010/dev-tools-dock-location.png';
import sources from './0010/dev-tools-sources.png';

Here's how you can access your browser's Developer Tools.

<Steps>
1. In the Edge, Chrome and Firefox browsers, you can toggle the developer tools by pressing the <kbd>F12</kbd> key.
1. You can choose where to dock the dev tools by clicking on the elipsis (&ellip;) on the toolbar.

    <Image src={dock} alt="Dock the Developer Tools"/>

1. Click on the *"Console"* tab. This will give you a dedicated REPL with which to perform live edits of your page using JavaScript.

    <Image src={console} alt="Console tab"/>

1. To view the actual script file(s) the browser has loaded, click on the *"Sources"* tab. Find and click on your JavaScript file from the navigator portion to see the source code for that file.

    <Image src={sources} alt="Sources tab"/>

    Within the Sources tab, you can set breakpoints to control execution of your code and then step through each line as part of your debugging efforts.

    Pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key while in the Sources tab will toggle a Console REPL just below the source code.
</Steps>

Many of the major browsers share the same underlying engine (*Chromium*), so your experience with the developer tools in each will be mostly identical.

  <TabItem label="MS Edge">
    Microsoft has extensive documentation on the DevTools in **Edge** (my own preferred browser these days - circa 2023).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Chrome">
    I quickly switched to Google Chrome back in 2008 largely because of the **comic book**. It's definitely worth the read, *especially* once you get into "real world" software development.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Firefox">
    Not too long after Chrome's first release, Microsoft and **Firefox** both switched to using the same underlying engine: *Chromium*.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using Node

Entering the Node REPL is fairly straight forward.

<Steps>
1. Open a terminal window on your computer.
1. Type `node` to enter the Node REPL.
1. Type `.help` for a list of the REPL commands, such as saving and loading external script files.
1. Type `.exit` in the REPL when you want to return to your terminal context.
</Steps>

## Ad-hoc Sandbox Pages

import Sandbox from '../tutorials/sandbox.mdx';

One of the distinguishing aspects of writing actual JavaScript files for a web page is that your code needs to contain complete statements. This is different from a REPL environment because the REPL will process *partial* as well as complete statements. The REPL also automatically gives you feedback on the result of what you are typing. This is different from the "real world" of JavaScript where *you* have to decide what (if anything) is worth displaying on the web page.

Here's some resources you can use for a stand-along web page to act as a "sandbox" for exploring JavaScript. You can also find this sandbox as part of the [related tutorial](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0050/) that introduces some basic JavaScript concepts.
