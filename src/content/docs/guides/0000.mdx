These guides offer general-purpose information along with code examples. These are not *walkthroughs* (like the tutorials). Rather, they are intended as "jumping-off" points for applying JavaScript to your own situations. After all, there is really no limit to what you can try to achieve in web application development. These guides offer a "What I wish I knew" kick-start for new programmers.
