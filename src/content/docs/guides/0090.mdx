**HTML forms** are the traditional way to capture user input and perform the types of tasks that make a website *useful* or *interactive* &mdash; it's how we build web *applications*. The caveat that we have to acknowledge with HTML forms is that we almost always do our most meaningful processing through a ***server response*** to the form's request.

<Aside type="caution">
In this course, we're dealing exclusively with ***client-side*** JavaScript, so our usage of HTML forms is somewhat artificial. This is especially true in how we will regularly be using the `.preventDefault()` method on the `'submit'` event object to prevent the form from posting a request to the web server. With that being said, let's explore form processing in the browser using JavaScript.

### Basic Form Structures

HTML can accommodate multiple forms on a single page, but it's important that those forms are not *nested* one within another. The `<form>` element is typically accompanied with a `method` attribute (whose value can be `POST` or `GET`) and an `action` attribute (which identifies the server resource or URL that the *request* is directed towards). These attributes have been omitted because we will only be performing client-side processing.

> ***Note:** With modern HTML/CSS, there are many aspects of form processing that no longer needs to be handled by JavaScript exclusively. Specifically, **simple form validation** is something that CSS and HTML can work together to perform quite cleanly. However, complex client-side validation is still quite firmly in the camp of requiring JavaScript.*
