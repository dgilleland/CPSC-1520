The *TLDR* for using `git` from the command line is to follow these steps.

<Steps>

1. Make sure you are in the terminal at the *root* of your repository. *(See [terminal commands] for navigating folders in the terminal.)*
1. Stage whatever files you want to commit. The simplest way is to add all of the changes you have done. Use this command (and don't forget the period).

   ```ps
   git add .
   ```

1. Commit your changes with a *meaningful* message.

   ```ps
   git commit -m "Short description"
   ```

1. Push to GitHub.

   ```ps
   git push
   ```
</Steps>
