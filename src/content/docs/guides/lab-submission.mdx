When your lab or assignment is a GitHub repository, submitting your work is simply a matter of **commit** and **push**.

You have a couple of ways to accomplish this. You can use the `git` commands directly from the terminal (*I strongly recommend this approach*) or you can use some <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> that "wraps around" git.

The secret to using git is to do ***frequent*** commits. This ensures that you have more "fall-back" points if you have to switch to an earlier version of your work, and it also makes your commit history easier to read and reason about.

You should also work to use *meaningful commit messages*. */}

See the section below for guidance on [writing commit messages](#commit-messages). Additionally, check out the [Terminal Commands](/CPSC-1520/reference/1000#git/) for a summary of the various `git` commands you can use.

## From The Command-Line (Recommended)

The *TLDR* for using `git` from the command line is to follow these steps.

<Steps>

1. Make sure you are in the terminal at the *root* of your repository. *(See [terminal commands](/CPSC-1520/reference/1000#navigating-the-terminal/) for navigating folders in the terminal.)*
1. Stage whatever files you want to commit. The simplest way is to add all of the changes you have done. Use this command (and don't forget the period).

   ```ps
   git add .
   ```

1. Commit your changes with a [*meaningful* message](#commit-messages).

   ```ps
   git commit -m "Short description"
   ```

1. Push to GitHub.

   ```ps
   git push
   ```
</Steps>

## From VS Code's Built-In GUI

Visual Studio Code has a built-in GUI that offers another way to commit and submit your work. To learn more about version control with VS Code's GUI tools, see <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview" target="_blank">their official documentation</a>.

<Steps>
1. Click on the source code tab from the sidebar (or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd>).

   <Image src={SourceCode} alt="Extensions Icon" />

1. Enter a [message](#commit-messages) in the text box with the *Message* placeholder.
1. Click the **Commit** button.
1. If you haven't staged the files for committing, a dialog will open asking if you want to stage and commit directly. Click **Yes**.
1. **Sync Changes** and if a dialog pops up asking you if you want to push and pull, click **Ok**.
</Steps>

## Commit Messages

When you start out, you might think that it doesn't matter much what message you put for your commit. **You're wrong!** Good commit messages have several benefits to "future you" and others you work with. They also indicate a commitment to following professional standards.

Your commit message should clearly indicate the following:

- **What** changed - Not in terms of file names, but in terms of the *scope* or *effects* of your change.
- **Why** it changed - Is it a bug fix? Or is it a new feature? Is it automted tests? Perphaps you've added documentation to clarify something important. Or, if it's just some chore, like clean-up of the code.
- **Where** I can find more details - This is typically some reference to an *issue* (see <a target="_blank" href="">GitHub Issues</a>).
- **How** it fits into the bigger picture - Does it *close* an issue, or is it a "work-in-progress" (WIP)? Does it involve a breaking change?

Astute writers among you might think, "He's missing the *Who* and *When*." Actually, git automatically includes the *"Who"* with your `user.name` and `user.email` (something you first set up when you installed git). The *"When"* is also provided behind the scenes as a *timestamp* on the commit.

Author TODO: Once the mermaid rendering is confirmed, add in a good example.

When looking over commit history (such as using `git log`), it should read like bullet points describing the 

```mermaid
gitGraph
   commit "Initial Commit"
```
*/}

In any case, here are some quick tips for writing good commit messages.

- Use a good prefix for the **first word** in the message to indicate the *type* of commit
- *Don't* end with punctuation
- Make it *descriptive* as a summary of what changed
- Keep it *short* (less than 50 characters is good)
- Avoid filler words
