When your lab or assignment is a GitHub repository, submitting your work is simply a matter of **commit** and **push**.

You have a couple of ways to accomplish this. You can use the `git` commands directly from the terminal (*I strongly recommend this approach*) or you can use some <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> that "wraps around" git.

The secret to using git is to do ***frequent*** commits. This ensures that you have more "fall-back" points if you have to switch to an earlier version of your work, and it also makes your commit history easier to read and reason about.

You should also work to use *meaningful commit messages*. */}

## From The Command-Line (Recommended)

The *TLDR* for using `git` from the command line is to follow these steps.

<Steps>

1. Make sure you are in the terminal at the *root* of your repository. *(See [terminal commands] for navigating folders in the terminal.)*
1. Stage whatever files you want to commit. The simplest way is to add all of the changes you have done. Use this command (and don't forget the period).

   ```ps
   git add .
   ```

1. Commit your changes with a *meaningful* message.

   ```ps
   git commit -m "Short description"
   ```

1. Push to GitHub.

   ```ps
   git push
   ```
</Steps>

## From VS Code's Built-In GUI

Visual Studio Code has a built-in GUI that offers another way to commit and submit your work. To learn more about version control with VS Code's GUI tools, see <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview" target="_blank">their official documentation</a>.

<Steps>
1. Click on the source code tab from the sidebar (or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd>).

1. Enter a message in the text box with the *Message* placeholder.
1. Click the **Commit** button.
1. If you haven't staged the files for committing, a dialog will open asking if you want to stage and commit directly. Click **Yes**.
1. **Sync Changes** and if a dialog pops up asking you if you want to push and pull, click **Ok**.
</Steps>
