## The Great Exchange

Web browsers work by *requesting* resources (pages, images, style sheets, etc.) from web servers. Web servers are simply computers that work to *respond* to requests for resources.

The protocol that web browsers use is called **HTTP**, which stands for *Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol*. Essentially, it's a mechanism that allows computers to communicate via simple "text" information.

Not only does the browser send requests via text, the web server **responds** with text. The response comes in two parts: The ***header*** and the ***body***. Note that when we talk about the HTTP response "headers", that is *not* the same thing as the `<head>` of an HTML document. The body of the response may be an HTML document, a CSS file, a JavaScript file, an image (*as **text***), etc. But the common aspect to all of it is that data is transfered as ***text***.

     Here's an example of a browser request given as raw text:

    ``` title="Request Headers"

### Resource Types

A lot of the time, we might think that our HTML page is "the thing" that's being requested by the browser. But that's hardly the case. While an HTML page is usually the *first* item requested, it is hardly ever the last.

Think of it. Our HTML markup indicates other resources that are part of the "page": Stylesheets and Fav Icons (`<link>` tags), JavaScript files (`<script>` tags), and Images (`<img>` tags) make up much of what our HTML markup tells the browser to include. And each one of those resources must be requested individually by the browser. While the browser might begin *rendering* (drawing) the HTML right away, it won't finish the whole job until the last of those resources is retrieved.

### Request Objects

You would probably be surprised at how much information your browser is sharing with the web server when it requests a resource. That includes data about the browser version, your operating system, your location (IP Address), "cookies", and sometimes a whole lot more. This is information that the browser sends to the web server so that the web server can give you an appropriate response. This is the "public" exchange of data that goes over the internet.

When the protocol is **HTTP**, all that information is sent as *plain text*. When you ask for **HTTPS**, your information is sent (and received) as *encrypted* text (giving you a measure of privacy, however small that might be).

### Response Objects

<Image src={logistics} alt="Response Objects" class="float-end ml-3 w-40" />

A key aspect of the response of a web server is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status" target="_blank">**status code**</a> of the response. Status codes fall into certain groupings.

| Status Group | Meaning | Most Common |
|:------------:|---------|------------|
| **1*xx*** | Informational | `100` - Continue |
| **2*xx*** | Successful | `200` - OK |
| **3*xx*** | Redirection | `304` - Not Modified |
| **4*xx*** | Client Error | `404` - Not Found |
| **5*xx*** | Server Error | `500` - Internal Server Error |


## Exploring with the Dev Tools

There's a "Network" tab in your browser's Dev Tools. With it, you can record and inspect a wide range of network activity taking place when your browser communicates with the web server.

You can even simulate network "latency" with the *Throttling* drop-down. This can be helpful if you want to see how your page is rendered when you are on limited connections.
