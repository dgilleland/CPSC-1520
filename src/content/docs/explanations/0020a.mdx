When you look at JavaScript code, look closely at each part and ask yourself, "What *is* it?"

Is this part of the code a *keyword*, an *operator* or *symbol*, or an *identifier*? If it's a keyword, then what is the *syntax* for that keyword, and how does it fit into the grammar of the overall instruction or line of code? If it's an operator or symbol, what is the *name* of that operator/symbol and what is its purpose? That symbol might be there for *grammatical* or *syntactic* reasons, or it might be *arithmetic*, or something else entirely. Lastly, if that bit of code is an *identifier*, then what is its *data type* and its *value*, and how does it fit into the grammar of the statement/instruction as a whole?

Even learning how to define the *terms* I've been throwing around (**syntax**, [**grammar**](/CPSC-1520/reference/0020/), **identifiers**, **objects**, etc.) will go a long way towards getting a handle on JavaScript as a language.
