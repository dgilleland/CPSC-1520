Are you totally new to JavaScript and the only "programming" background you have is HTML and/or CSS? Odds are that JavaScript will feel pretty different to you.

This explanation might help you get the basics of how JavaScript works, which will be fundamental as you move forward. Consider this your "A-B-C"s look at JavaScript.

## <u>A</u> Sequence of Steps

The first thing to know about JavaScript is that its job is to tell the computer ***how*** to do something **step-by-step**. Think of it as a "tutor" for the browser, telling it to "Do this. Now do that."

We use the word **statement** to describe the idea of a complete instruction (whether simple or complex). In other words, it's a *single step* that we want our computer to perform.

It's not just about instructions, though. It's also about **information**. The instructions are there in order to do something *with* or *to* some piece of information. We hold or represent information in something called *variables*.

<Aside>
    A good companion to this explanation is my article "What is a Computer Program?" That article complements this by providing another perspective on understanding how JavaScript works.

    AUTHOR TODO: Add link in paragraph above....
</Aside>

The following code illustrates a step-by-step approach to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle. Here, we're making our steps ultra-small, to illustrate the sequence.

```js
// simple-sequence.js
// We want variables to hold information
let leftSide;   // The rectangle's left side
let topSide;    // The rectangle's top side
let perimeter;  // For the final result

// Now we need our initial information
leftSide = 3;
rightSide = 4;

// Time to do some math
perimeter = leftSide + leftSide + topSide + topSide;

// Display the result
console.log('The perimeter is:', perimeter);
```


## <u>B</u>undles of Instructions

The second thing to know about JavaScript is that it allows us to create ***functions***. Think of functions as small sets of instructions dedicated to accomplish some specific task. The benefit of functions are two-fold:

- They give us the benefit of **re-use**, because we can *call* our functions as often and wherever we want.
- They allow us to focus around individual tasks or goals.

To give you an idea of how essential functions are, all JavaScript environments come with hundreds of built-in functions. They include functions that

- Manipulate text and numbers,
- Perform complex math operations,
- Work with dates, and
- Manipulate arrays.

That's a short list of categories, and each one can contain dozens of functions we can call to get jobs done.

<Image src={answer} alt="The answer for life, the universe and everything" class="float-end ml-3" width="300" />

For a concrete example, consider the fact that all user input/output comes in textual form. That's true even when we are asking the user to give us a number. That means we need some *function* that can convert from a string to a number. Consider this code snippet based on the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"[^a]. It uses the `parseInt()` function.

[^a]: "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is a book by Douglas Adams. The "42" image is from <a target="_blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Answer_to_Life_42.svg">WikiMedia</a>.

{/* Whether it is through an input control on a form (`<input name="height" />`) or through a user prompt (`prompt("Enter a height in inches"`), the raw values are textual in nature. */}

```js "parseInt(input)"
// sampleInput.js
// According to the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" the expected input is '42'
let input = prompt("What's the answer for life, the universe and everything?");
let answer = parseInt(input); // Changes '42' into 42
```

We're not limited to the functions that come with JavaScript. We can create our own!

### Declaring vs. Calling

A **function declaration** is where we state exactly what our function will *do*. Here's a sample.

```js title="Calculate perimeter" "promptPerimeter"
const promptPerimeter = function(openingName) {
  let textInput = prompt(`Enter the height for ${openingName} (in inches).`);
  let height = parseInt(textInput);
  textInput = prompt(`Enter the width for ${openingName} (in inches).`);
  let width = parseInt(textInput);
  return height * 2 + width * 2;
}
```

It's not enough to declare our function. We would need to also **call** our function. Imagine that we wanted to get the amount of wood to frame a set of three windows for a room.

```js title="Calculate total length" "promptPerimeter"
let totalLength = promptPerimeter('the North window');
totalLength = totalLength + promptPerimeter('the East window');
totalLength = totalLength + promptPerimeter('the West window');
console.log('The total length (in inches):', totalLength);
```

Without functions, our code could potentially grow to an unreasonable (and un-maintainable) size. Here's what we would need to code if we couldn't make our own functions.

```js
// redundant-code.js
// We want variables to hold information
let textInput;    // All input comes in as strings
let height;
let width;
let totalLength;  // For the final result

// Get the first window details
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for North window (in inches).");
height = parseInt(textInput); // e.g.: changes '22' into 22
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for North window (in inches).");
width = parseInt(textInput);

totalLength = height * 2 + width * 2;

// Get the second window details
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for East window (in inches).");
height = parseInt(textInput); // e.g.: changes '22' into 22
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for East window (in inches).");
width = parseInt(textInput);

totalLength = totalLength + height * 2 + width * 2;

// Get the third window details
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for West window (in inches).");
height = parseInt(textInput); // e.g.: changes '22' into 22
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for West window (in inches).");
width = parseInt(textInput);

totalLength = totalLength + height * 2 + width * 2;

// Output the result;
console.log("The total length (in inches):", totalLength);
```

<Aside title="DRY Principle">
  Functions allow us to avoid code duplication. This is known as following the **DRY principle**. *DRY* stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself".
</Aside>

## <u>C</u>ontrol Flow

It's not all simple-sequence and method calls when it comes to the execution of our code. Often times we want our program to *choose* different paths of logic or to do things repeatedly. We can write those kinds of instructions with "If/Else" and looping structures.

This third aspect of JavaScript programming is all about **Flow Control** - deciding which instructions to execute.

### Altenate Paths of Logic

Imagine we needed to calculate a shape's area given two dimensions: width and height. We might need to use different formulas depending on whether the shape is a triangle or a rectangle.

- If/Else

### Repetition

- Loop

```js
```


## <u>D</u>isplaying Results

We don't use JavaScript in a vacuum. JavaScript - in its most common use - is in support of our HTML content. We want to display the results of our work to the user.
