Are you totally new to JavaScript and the only "programming" background you have is HTML and/or CSS? Odds are that JavaScript will feel pretty different to you.

This explanation might help you get the basics of how JavaScript works, which will be fundamental as you move forward. Consider this your "A-B-C"s look at JavaScript.

## <u>A</u> Sequence of Steps

The first thing to know about JavaScript is that its job is to tell the computer ***how*** to do something **step-by-step**. Think of it as a "tutor" for the browser, telling it to "Do this. Now do that."

We use the word **statement** to describe the idea of a complete instruction (whether simple or complex). In other words, it's a *single step* that we want our computer to perform.

It's not just about instructions, though. It's also about **information**. The instructions are there in order to do something *with* or *to* some piece of information. We hold or represent information in something called *variables*.

<Aside>
    A good companion to this explanation is my article "What is a Computer Program?" That article complements this by providing another perspective on understanding how JavaScript works.

The following code illustrates a step-by-step approach to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle. Here, we're making our steps ultra-small, to illustrate the sequence.

```js
// We want variables to hold information
let leftSide;   // The rectangle's left side
let topSide;    // The rectangle's top side
let perimeter;  // For the final result

// Now we need our initial information
leftSide = 3;
rightSide = 4;

// Time to do some math
perimeter = leftSide + leftSide + topSide + topSide;

// Display the result
console.log('The perimeter is:', perimeter);
```


## <u>B</u>undles of Instructions

- DRY principle
- Functions
  - `return` vs. *default* return value


```js
// redundant-code.js
```

```js
// modularized-code.js
```


## <u>C</u>ontrol Flow

- If/Else
- Loop

```js
```


## <u>D</u>isplaying Results

We don't use JavaScript in a vacuum. JavaScript - in its most common use - is a support for our HTML content. We want to display the results of our work to the user.


```js
```

## <u>E</u>vent Handling

Another way JavaSCript supports our HTML is allowing users to *interact* with our web page.
