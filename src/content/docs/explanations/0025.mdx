Are you totally new to JavaScript and the only "programming" background you have is HTML and/or CSS? Odds are that JavaScript will feel pretty different to you.

This explanation might help you get the basics of how JavaScript works, which will be fundamental as you move forward. Consider this your **"A-B-C"s** look at JavaScript.

----

## <u>A</u> Sequence of Steps

The first thing to know about JavaScript is that its job is to tell the computer ***how*** to do something **step-by-step**. Think of it as a "tutor" for the browser, telling it to "Do this. Now do that."

We use the word **statement** to describe the idea of a complete instruction (whether simple or complex). In other words, it's a *single step* that we want our computer to perform.

It's not just about instructions, though. It's also about **information**. The instructions are there in order to do something *with* or *to* some piece of information. We hold or represent information in something called *variables*.

<Aside>
    A good companion to this explanation is my article "What is a Computer Program?" That article complements this by providing another perspective on understanding how JavaScript works.

    AUTHOR TODO: Add link in paragraph above....
</Aside>

### Code Samples

The following code illustrates **Simple Sequence**. It's a step-by-step approach to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle. Here, we're making our steps ultra-small, to illustrate the sequence. We're giving the browser instructions to execute, one after the other.

```js
// simple-sequence.js
// We want variables to hold information
let leftSide;   // The rectangle's left side
let topSide;    // The rectangle's top side
let perimeter;  // For the final result

// Now we need our initial information
leftSide = 3;
topSide = 4;

// Time to do some math
perimeter = leftSide + leftSide + topSide + topSide;

// Display the result
console.log('The perimeter is:', perimeter);
// output:   The perimeter is: 12
```

One of the big consequences of simple sequence is that certain steps *must* happen before others. For example, you must have values assigned to `leftSide` and `topSide` **before** you to try to calculate the `perimeter`.

<Aside type="tip">
  Did you notice the semicolons ending each line? Those act as *punctuation*, indicating the end of an individual instruction to be performed. This is just one aspect of understanding [JavaScript as a language](/CPSC-1520/explanations/0020/).
</Aside>

Another aspect is that later changes to a variable's value won't affect prior calculations. Consider this example.

```js
// simple-sequence-2.js
let total;
let quantity = 10;
let price = 5.95;

total = quantity * price;
console.log('The total is:', total);
// output:   The total is: 59.5

quantity = 20;
console.log('The total is still:', total);
// output:    The total is still: 59.5
```

Contrast that with CSS which uses entirely different rules when applying styles. In the following stylesheet, the last border style overrides (replaces) the previous one.

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 3rem;
  border-left: 1px;
}

/* ... more styles ... */

h1 {
  border-left: 5px;
  padding-left: 3px;
}
```


----

## <u>B</u>undles of Instructions

The second thing to know about JavaScript is that it allows us to create ***functions***. Think of functions as small sets of instructions dedicated to accomplish some specific task. The benefit of functions are two-fold:

- They give us the benefit of **re-use**, because we can *call* our functions as often and wherever we want.
- They allow us to focus around individual tasks or goals.

To give you an idea of how essential functions are, all JavaScript environments come with hundreds of built-in functions. They include functions that

- Manipulate text and numbers,
- Perform complex math operations,
- Work with dates, and
- Manipulate arrays.

That's a short list of categories, and each one can contain dozens of functions we can call upon to get jobs done.

<Image src={answer} alt="The answer for life, the universe and everything" class="float-end ml-3" width="300" />

For a concrete example, consider the fact that all user input/output comes in textual form. That's true even when we are asking the user to give us a number. That means we need some *function* that can convert from a string to a number. Consider this code snippet based on the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"[^a]. It uses the `parseInt()` function.

[^a]: "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is a book by Douglas Adams. The "42" image is from <a target="_blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Answer_to_Life_42.svg">WikiMedia</a>.

{/* Whether it is through an input control on a form (`<input name="height" />`) or through a user prompt (`prompt("Enter a height in inches"`), the raw values are textual in nature. */}

```js "parseInt(input)"
// sampleInput.js
// According to the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" the expected input is '42'
let input = prompt("What's the answer for life, the universe and everything?");
let answer = parseInt(input); // Changes '42' into 42
```

We're not limited to the functions that come with JavaScript. We can create our own!

### Declaring vs. Calling

A **function declaration** is where we state exactly what our function will do. Here's a sample.

```js title="Calculate perimeter" "promptPerimeter"
const promptPerimeter = function(openingName) {
  let textInput = prompt(`Enter the height for ${openingName} (in inches).`);
  let height = parseInt(textInput);
  textInput = prompt(`Enter the width for ${openingName} (in inches).`);
  let width = parseInt(textInput);
  return height * 2 + width * 2;
}
```

It's not enough to declare our function. We would need to also **call** our function. Imagine that we wanted to get the amount of wood to frame a set of three windows for a room.

```js title="Calculate total length" "promptPerimeter"
let totalLength = promptPerimeter('the North window');
totalLength = totalLength + promptPerimeter('the East window');
totalLength = totalLength + promptPerimeter('the West window');
console.log('The total length (in inches):', totalLength);
```

Without functions, our code could potentially grow to an unreasonable (and un-maintainable) size. Here's what we would need to code if we couldn't make our own functions.

```js
// redundant-code.js
// We want variables to hold information
let textInput;    // All input comes in as strings
let height;
let width;
let totalLength;  // For the final result

// Get the first window details
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for North window (in inches).");
height = parseInt(textInput); // e.g.: changes '22' into 22
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for North window (in inches).");
width = parseInt(textInput);

totalLength = height * 2 + width * 2;

// Get the second window details
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for East window (in inches).");
height = parseInt(textInput); // e.g.: changes '22' into 22
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for East window (in inches).");
width = parseInt(textInput);

totalLength = totalLength + height * 2 + width * 2;

// Get the third window details
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for West window (in inches).");
height = parseInt(textInput); // e.g.: changes '22' into 22
textInput = prompt("Enter the height for West window (in inches).");
width = parseInt(textInput);

totalLength = totalLength + height * 2 + width * 2;

// Output the result;
console.log("The total length (in inches):", totalLength);
```

That's a **lot** more code! Without the ability to make our own functions, our code would grow exponentially if we wanted our program to accomplish more than it currently does.

<Aside title="DRY Principle">
  Functions allow us to avoid *code duplication*. This is known as following the **DRY principle**. *DRY* stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself".
</Aside>

{/* 
### The Call Stack

A huge part of what makes function calls work is the **call stack**.

Recall that JavaScript executes statements in-order as [a sequence of steps](#a-sequence-of-steps). You might be wondering how that works with function calls.
*/}

## <u>C</u>ontrol Flow

It's not all simple-sequence and method calls when it comes to the execution of our code. Often times we want our program to *choose* different paths of logic or to do things repeatedly. We can write those kinds of instructions with "If/Else" and looping structures.

This third aspect of JavaScript programming is all about **Flow Control** - deciding which instructions to execute.

### Conditionals

The idea of a **conditional** is to provide our code with ***Alternate Paths of Logic*** during execution. Essentially, we can introduce a "condition" as some decision that can be made as the computer is executing our code. Based on whether the condition is `true` or `false`, certain code will run while other code will not.

The `if...else` statement in JavaScript allows us to set up a *test* (or *condition*) to determine if we want to run certain code. For example, consider the fact that Math does not allow division by zero. We might have code like this.

```js title="if Statement"
// imagine some code above has obtained input from the user
if (count > 0) {
  average = total / count;
}
```

This tells the computer to only compute the average when the count is greater than zero. If the value of count is zero (`0`), then the average will *not* be computed, thus avoiding the division by zero error. (Additionally, we're avoiding negative `count` values because a negative average typically doesn't make sense).

Notice how the code inside the curly braces will only run if the *condition* - `(count > 0)` - is `true`. The `if` statement also offers an optional `else` side to allow us to do something when the conditional expression produces a `false` result.

```js title="if...else Statement"
// imagine some code above has obtained input from the user
if (count > 0) {
  average = total / count;
} else {
  console.log('That is an invalid count:', count);
}
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Check the Grammar">
  JavaScript is different from other type-safe languages when it comes to conditionals. JavaScript allows the conditional expression to be *truthy* or *falsy*. See the [Simplified JavaScript Grammar](/CPSC-1520/reference/0020/#conditional-expressions) on conditional expressions for more details.
</Aside>

### Loops

The idea of a **loop** is to execute one or more lines of code more than once. Whereas a *conditional* statement allows for *alternate paths of logic*, loops allows for ***Repetition*** of logic. Like the `if...else` examples above, the thing that controls the repetition is some *conditional expression* or *decision*.

#### While Statements

There are many looping statements in JavaScript. The oldest, and most general-purpose, is the `while` statement. As a simplistic example, consider the following code. It outputs the numbers 1 through 10 to the console.

```js title="while Statement"
let count = 1;
while (count <= 10) {
  console.log(`Item ${count}`);
  count = count + 1;
}
```

The conditional expression - `(count <= 10)` - controls the repetition of the code inside the curly braces. As long as that expression results in a true or *truthy* value, the code will repeat. Also note that the value of `count` is modified inside the curly braces. Each time through the loop, its value increases by one, until it ultimately holds the value `11`. At that point, the conditional expression results in a `false`, causing the loop to exit.

#### For Statements

Another popular looping statement is the `for` statement. Look again at the code for the `while` statement. Notice how there are three instructions that control the repetition:

- `let count = 1` - Creates the variable and gives it an *initial value*
- `count <= 10` - The conditional expression controlling entry to the code in the curly braces
- `count = count + 1` - Changes the value of the variable tested in the conditional expression

```js title="while Statement" "let count = 1" "count <= 10" "count = count + 1"
let count = 1;
while (count <= 10) {
  console.log(`Item ${count}`);
  count = count + 1;
}
```

The `for` statement brings all three of these instructions into one place, making it easier to see what affects execution of the code in the curly braces.

```js title="for Statement" "let count = 1" "count <= 10" "count = count + 1"
// An alternative to our while statement
for (let count = 1; count <= 10; count = count + 1) {
  console.log(`Item ${count}`);
}
```

Looping structures are a powerful way to control the *flow of execution* of our code. These, along with conditional statements, are great candidates for use inside of functions.

## <u>D</u>isplaying Results

We don't use JavaScript in a vacuum. JavaScript - in its most common use - is in support of our HTML content. We often want to display the results of our work to the user. It might be in an overt way (e.g.: modifying content on the page) or it might be in subtle ways (e.g.: changing styles or applying CSS classes).

This is the part where JavaScript interacts with something outside of itself. Remember that JavaScript, as an interpreted language, is being executed by the **web browser**. The browser makes the web page available to our JavaScript code through a "global" variable - the `document` object.

The `document` object is a very complex representation of everything on the page. It's referred to as the **Document Object Model**, or *DOM*. Through that `document` object we have access to functions that allow us to find individual parts of our page. Once we can access those, we are then free to modify them. We can even add or remove parts of our page entirely through the *DOM API* functions!

Here's a simple example. This code creates a variable that will *reference* or point to the first `<h1>` element on our page. Using that variable, it applies a CSS style to change the appearance of the element.

```js title="Add some sparkle"
let h1Tag = document.querySelector('h1'); // Find the first <h1>
h1Tag.classList.add('hover-sparkle');     // Give it a CSS class
```

## <u>E</u>vent Handling

The last significant way JavaScript supports our HTML is by allowing users to *interact* with our web page. This is accomplished by **listening to events**.

We can write code that instructs the browser to run certain functions when various events occur. For example, a user might **click** on some part of our page, like a heading or a button. Or they might **submit** a form. Another example is that they might want to select and **drag** one part of the page onto another part of the page.

```js title="Drag example" ".addEventListener"
let myList = document.querySelector('ul#priority-list');
myList.addEventListener('drag', moveItem);
```

The tutorial [*Intro to Event Listeners*](/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0070/) is a great introduction to creating interative user experiences.
