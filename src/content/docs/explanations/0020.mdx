JavaScript is a *programming language* that we - as developers - write in order to add functionality to our websites. In this article, I want to explore what it means when we say "JavaScript is a language".

## What is a language?

In human languages, we see that they are made up of *words*, *punctuation* and *grammar*. English is a great example. The *words* you  are reading right now are part of English. If you see a word you don't immediately recognize &ndash; like <a target="rabbit_trail" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/philology">*philology*</a> &ndash; you can look it up in a dictionary to discover its meaning.

You've probably already recognize the other aspects: *punctuation* and *grammar*. Grammar helps you derive meaning from words. Grammar provides the *rules* for assembling and ordering individual words (think <a target="rabbit_trail" href="https://www.thoughtco.com/subjects-verbs-and-objects-1689695">*subject*, *verb*, and *object*</a>). <a target="rabbit_trail" href="https://www.thoughtco.com/punctuation-definition-1691702">Punctuation</a> refers to special marks or symbols used to create structure by separating a series of words. Things like periods (`.`), exclamation marks (`!`) and question marks (`?`) affect meaning and interpretation.

>
> - *Gerald is innocent!*
> - *Gerald is innocent?*

> The first implies confidence, while the second implies doubt.

But there's one more characteristic of English: *Names*. We give names to people and places. *Names* are a bit different from the other *words* in the language in that you won't find most people and place names in a <a target="rabbit_trail" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/">dictionary</a>. <a target="rabbit_trail" href="https://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Willamina">"Willamina"</a> and <a target="rabbit_trail" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetaskiwin">"Wetaskiwin"</a> are good examples. We even use names for certain things or objects, and with popular use those names occasionally make it into our dictionaries as legitimate words. Names tend to be things we *invent*. Examples include names for products (<a target="rabbit_trail" href="https://www.sto.com/biomimetics/en/biomimetics/lotusan/index.html">Lotusan&reg;</a>) and companies. Who can forget the mis-spelling that created <a target="rabbit_trail" href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/google-name">Google</a>?

As we grapple with understanding and using JavaScript, the first part of our journey is to recognize that **JavaScript is a *language***.

## JavaScript As A Language

JavaScript is a *high-level language* software developers use to write computer programs. By "high-level", we mean that the language approaches the understandableness of Engligh (humans can read it and get an idea of what is happening).

<blockquote style="border-left-width: 8px; border-left-color: #f97316;" class="text-orange-500 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 text-3xl italic p-5 py-3">
    {/* The inline style is to increase specificity. The Tailwind equivalent is "border-l-8 border-orange-500" */}
    A computer program is a set of instructions for manipulating information.

But JavaScript is also a language that computers need to "understand".
