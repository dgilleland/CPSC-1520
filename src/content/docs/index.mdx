## About This Site (&copy; 2024/25 - Dan Gilleland)

I'm starting this as a place to create ad-hoc notes that support my CPSC-1520 classes in January 2025. It's raw, it's not done, but it will be ***accurate***. Here's the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dgilleland/CPSC-1520/issues/1">roadmap</a> of what I'm creating.
