## About This Site (&copy; 2024/25 - Dan Gilleland)

I'm starting this as a place to create ad-hoc notes that support my CPSC-1520 classes in January 2025. It's raw, it's not done, but it will be ***accurate***. Here's the [roadmap](https://github.com/dgilleland/CPSC-1520/issues/1) of what I'm creating.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Sporatically Updated" icon="add-document">
		This is <b>NOT</b> a substitute for your student workbook or attending Dan's classes. Rather, it's a supplement that Dan will add random things to.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Work In Progress" icon="pencil">
		This site is a <i>Work in Progress</i> (<abbr>WIP</abbr>).
	</Card>
	<Card title="Have a Suggestion?" icon="setting">
		You know Dan. You have an idea. Tell him!
	</Card>
	<Card title="Read the docs" icon="open-book">
		Learn more in [the Starlight Docs](https://starlight.astro.build/).
