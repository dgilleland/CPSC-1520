Make version control part of your daily routine.


Whether you are working with dedicated focus in a single repository or switching between several repositories while jumping from task-to-task, a **personal discipline** of ***frequent* and *small* commits** will bring 

## Rinse and Repeat ðŸ•—

<Steps>
1. #### Prep for Work

    As you sit down to start your work, make sure your repository is **up-to-date** with any changes since you've last seen it. This is vital if you are working as part of a team. It also helps you if you are a solo-developer.
    
    - `git status` (and cleanup, if any)
    - `git pull` for latest changes
    
    The goal is to make sure any recent work from the remote repository is downloaded to your local computer.

1. #### Work

    You write **code**. You create **documentation** (preferably in *markdown*). If you love yourself, you even write **automated tests**!

    Whatever it is you are doing, you will hit points where you have completed some task, however small. That's a *milestone*. It's also a good time to commit your work.

    - `git status` to see what's been happening in your working directory
    - `git add .` to stage changes
    - `git commit -m "Your Comment"`

    ----

1. #### Wrap Up

    You don't have to do a `git push` every time you commit. You can build up several commits before you send them up to the remote repository. As a rule of thumb, however, you should never end the day without having pushed at least *once*.

    - `git pull` because you should see if any of your team have contributed to the code base
    - `git push` to share the work you've done for the day

    The combination of *push* and *pull* is how you *synchronize* your work.

Are you done for the day? Then enjoy a good night's sleep, and remember to start the routine again the next day!
