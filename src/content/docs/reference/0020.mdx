Take, for example, some of the grammar around **variable declarations** and **program statements**. A simplified grammar for declaring a variable in JavaScript would look like this:

```csharp
  [var | let | const] variableName
```

Central to the grammar of JavaScript is the notion of **program statements**. 

By itself, this variable declaration is not enough to produce a complete instruction in JavaScript. We have to combine the *variable declaration* grammar with the grammar for a *program statement* in order to make a single instruction telling the computer to create the variable. In general, a program statement must be a statement that ends with a semicolon (`;`). In other words, the *program statement* grammar requires the semicolon as "punctuation", much in the same way that English sentences must end in a period. Thus, our completed syntax for creating a variable would be

`int count;`


*/}

The many small rules in the JavaScript programming language is its ***grammar***. These rules specify the accepted way to write JavaScript code. Unless your code follows the grammar of JavaScript, the computer won't understand (or worse, might mis-interpret) what you're telling it to do.

Individually, each rule in itself is not enough to produce complete working code. Instead, the rules are like building blocks, offering various ways to assemble or construct your code.

> A language **grammar** is a set of small rules that can be combined to produce the **syntax** of your code.

### Using This Grammar

The formal grammar for JavaScript is actually quite large and complex. In fact, the grammars for most programming languages are so complex that they require another "language" to describe the grammar. An early and fairly standard language or means to express grammars is the **Bakus-Naur Form**, or *BNF*.

For our purposes, we will present a much more *simplified* grammar. The following sections express the bulk of the JavaScript grammar used in this introductory JavaScript course.

Most of the grammar rules in JavaScript are quite short, defining the order of **keywords**, **identifiers** and **symbols**/**operators**. In the following grammars, highlighted portions indicate a part of the grammar where you would need to *substitute* some appropriate code. For example, the `for` statement has four items that you would replace with code specific to your application. The required portions of the grammar are the keywords (`for`) and symbols (parenthesis and semicolons).

```js "[initialization]" "conditionalExpression" "[incrementation]" "statementOrStatementBlock"
for([initialization]; conditionalExpression; [incrementation])
   statementOrStatementBlock
```

<Aside>
  Much of this simpified grammar involves individual program statements. These individual instructions run sequentially, one after the other, so the order of individual instructions is important. For more on this, see [How JavaScript Works](/CPSC-1520/explanations/0025).
</Aside>

## Common Grammar Elements

### Program Statements and Statement blocks

Individual instructions are known as **Program Statements**. The instructions can be short and simple, or they can be long and complex. In either case, the program statement *should* end in a semicolon (`;`), though the grammar allows them to be omitted.

Besides individual instructions, we can group individual statements into **Statement Blocks**. A statement block is a set of zero or more program statements that are enclosed in a set of curly braces (`{ }`). Statement blocks are frequently used with **Flow Control Statements** (such as the `if` and `for` statements).

<Aside type="tip">
  Follow the common [style guide](/CPSC-1520/reference/1200/) when writing JavaScript. For **statement blocks**, the opening curly brace should always be at the end of the same line as the statement it applies to.
</Aside>


<Aside title="Always Use Semicolons in JavaScript" type="caution">
  If you are [missing semicolons](/CPSC-1520/explanations/semicolons/) in your code, most JavaScript engines (like the ones in your browser) will attempt to *interpret* where it thinks the semicolons should go as it is processing your code. This is referred to a **Automatic Semicolon Insertion** (ASI), and it can lead to problems in your code.

  The danger of *not* putting in the semicolons yourself is that **it's too easy to make a mistake**. If the JavaScript engine *mis*-interprets your code by putting semicolons where you don't expect them, then your code might not do what you're hoping it will.

  Consider this (bad) example of code. The programmer's attempt is to return an object, but the value `undefined` will be returned instead.

  ```js
  return
  {
    key: 'value'
  }
  ```

  JavaScript ASI will "re-write" the code as follows.

  ```js ";"
  return;
  {
    key: 'value'
  }
  ```

### Literal Values

A literal value is a piece of "raw" information or data that is embedded into our code. JavaScript offers several types of literals. The more commonly used ones are as follows.

- **String literals** - Any text enclosed in single or double quotes. `'Hello'` and `"Stewart's home!"` are examples of string literals.
- **Numeric literals** - One or more digits combined to make a number. `42` and `3.14159` are examples of numeric literals, where the first one is an integer literal (whole number) and the second is a floating-point literal (the value includes a decimal point).
- **Boolean literals** - JavaScript has two keywords which represent literal boolean values: `true` and `false`.
- **Array literals** - Any set of values enclosed withint square brackets (`[]`). It can be empty - `[]` - or include values - `['Ace', 'King', 'Queen'].`
- **Object literals** - Any set of zero or more pairs of property names and values enclosed within curly braces (`{}`). This should not be confused with the use of curly braces that represents a *statement block*.

There are additional types of literals in JavaScript that are used for specific purposes. These include the following.

- **Template literals** - A variation of the string literal, but where the text is enclosed with backticks (`` ` ``).
- **RegExp literals** - A pattern for matching string values, enslosed between a pair of slashes (`/`).

For links to more detailed descriptions, see the MDN article on <LinkButton href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Literal" target="_blank" icon='external' variant='minimal'>**Literals**.</LinkButton>

#### Template Strings

The difference between template and string literals is that all of the text inside a string is considered a literal value whereas template literals can include *variables* or *expressions* through the use of placeholders. For example, in the following code, everything between the backticks are the literal parts of the string while the `${firstName}` is not.

```js
`Welcome to ${firstName}'s world!`
```

If the value of `firstName` is `"Wayne"`, then the resulting text would be `Welcome to Wayne's world!`.

Template strings work across multiple lines as well. Consider this example.

```js
welcome = `<h1>
  Welcome ${firstName}!
  <span class="badge">${rating}</span>
</h1>`;
```

Regular strings have to be entirely on the same physical line in JavaScript. If you want to built your string literal using line breaks, use template strings instead.

It's important to note that the placeholder in a template string is, itself, an [expression](#expressions). Thus, you can have any expression to generate a value that will be used in the placeholder. Here's a slightly more complex example of a template string where the expression makes use of a **ternary expression**.

```js
//  Template strings use placeholders to "place" a value in a certain spot.
//  ${} is a placeholder  /¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\
console.log(`main toggle: ${ target.checked ? 'it is on' : 'it is off'}`);
//                           \ true|false /   \_ true _/   \_ false _/
//     if target.checked is      true         'it is on'
//     if target.checked is      false                     'it is off'
```


----

### Expressions

An **Expression** is any combination of *literal values*, *identifiers*, *operators* (such as the arithmetic operators), and/or *method calls* (where the method returns a value). When an expression is processed, a single value is produced. This value can then be used in whatever operation the expressions occurs. For example, the value might be passed into a method as part of a method call, or it might be placed in a variable as part of an assignment statement.

---

### Variable Declarations

Before a variable can be used, it must be *declared*. How you declare a variable will affect its *scope* and whether its value can be changed. There are three keywords in JavaScript for declaring variables:  `var`, `let` and `const`.

<LinkButton target="_blank" icon='external' variant='secondary' iconPlacement='start' href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">`let` keyword <Badge text="MDN" size="small" variant="note" /></LinkButton>
<LinkButton target="_blank" icon='external' variant='secondary' iconPlacement='start' href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">`var` keyword <Badge text="MDN" size="small" variant="note" /></LinkButton>
<LinkButton target="_blank" icon='external' href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const" variant='secondary' iconPlacement='start'>`const` keyword <Badge text="MDN" size="small" variant="note" /></LinkButton>

#### `let` and `var`

The `let` statement declares a variable with block-level scope. The `var` statement declares a variable with function-scope or global scope.

```js "variableName" "[= expression]" title="let Statement"
let variableName [= expression];
```

```js "variableName" "[= expression]" title="var Statement"
var variableName [= expression];
```

In both cases, `variablename` is a programmer-defined **identifier** (name) to represent a value. An optional initial value may be assigned, as denoted by `[= expression]`, where `expression` is any valid JavaScript expression. If no value is assigned to the variable, it's initial value is `undefined`. The datatype of the variable is always determined by the value stored in that variable.


#### `const`

The `const` statement declares a variable whose value cannot be changed. The value must be assigned when the variable is declared.

```js "variableName" "expression" title="const Statement"
const variableName = expression;
```

Again, `variablename` is a programmer-defined **identifier** (name) while `expression` is any valid JavaScript expression.


---

### Assignment Operation

```js "variableName" "assignmentOperator" "expression" title="Varible Assignment"
variableName assignmentOperator expression
```

**Assignment Operations** are operations where a value is assigned or stored in a variable. The parts of the grammar are the

- `variableName` - the name of the variable that will receive/store the value.
- `assignmentOperator` - one of the following:
  - **`=`** Equals
  - **`+=`** Plus-Equals
  - **`-=`** Minus-Equals
  - **`*=`** Multiply-Equals
  - **`/=`** Divide-Equals
  - **`%=`** Modulus-Equals
- `expression` - any valid JavaScript expression

An assignment operation is made into an **assignment statement** by adding a semicolon to the end of the operation. For example,

```js title="Assignment Statement"
total = price * quantity;
```

----

### Arithmetic Operators

**Arithmetic Operators** are used to manipulate numeric information mathematically. They are used in [expressions](#expressions) to produce a single value. Most arithmetic operators are **binary** operators, where the operator sits "between" to items (one on the left-hand side, one on the right-hand side). The left-hand and right-hand sides of an operator are called **operands**.

```js "leftHand" "Operator" "rightHand" title="Binary Operators"
leftHand operator rightHand
```

The parts of the grammar are the

- `leftHand` - any valid JavaScript expression
- `operator` - one of the following:
  - **`+`** Plus
  - **`-`** Minus
  - **`*`** Multiply
  - **`/`** Divide
  - **`%`** Modulus
- `rightHand` - any valid JavaScript expression

Expressions can contain complex arithmetic operations, but each operation is *evaluated* (turned into a single value) one at a time. The order of operations follows standard operation precedence in math (multiplication, division and modulus before addition and subtraction). When the precedence of operators are the same, the order of operations is performed from left to right. This order can be overridden using parenthesis. The following is an illustration of the order of operations for a complex arithmetic expression.

```js title="Operator Precedence"
    (10 + 5 + 12) / 3 + 4.5 * 2
//  (10 + 5 + 12)                 Parenthesis takes Precedence
//   10 + 5                       First operation - Addition
//      ⇩
//      15  + 12                  Second operation - Addition
//          ⇩
//          27    / 3             Third operation - Division
//                ⇩
//                9   + 4.5 * 2
//                      4.5 * 2   Fourth operation - Multiplication
//                          ⇩
//                9    +    9     Fifth operation - Addition
//                     ⇩
//                     18         Final value
```

Arithmetic operators are intended for use with numbers. When either operand is not a number, the JavaScript engine will attempt to convert the operand into a number. The only exception is when the plus &mdash; `+` &mdash; operator is used and one or more operands are not numbers; in this case, the `+` operator is used to perform *string concatenation*.

----

## Flow-Control Statements

Flow-Control Statements are a crucial part of the procedural characteristics within the JavaScript language. They provide the capabilities of ***alternative paths of logic*** (`if-else` and `switch`) and ***repetition*** (`for`, `while` and their variants). They also provide the ability to "jump into" functions through ***function calls***.

All flow-control statement grammars include a reference to **`statementOrStatementBlock`**. When using a **Statement Block**, the opening curly brace must be on the same line as the initial statement (as per [accepted JavaScript style guides](/CPSC-1520/reference/1200/)). The provided samples are shown with the use of *statement blocks*.

- `statementOrStatementBlock` is either a **single** statement or a **single** statement *block* (zero or more statements inside curly braces - `{ }`).
  - A single statement can be on its own line.
  - A statement block should have the opening curly brace at then end of the same line as the initial statement and the closing curly brace on its own line.

The following is an example of a statement block with properly positioned curly braces.

```js title="Sample Code"
if(quantity === 0) {
  // zero or more lines of code
}
```

----

### Conditional Expressions

Conditional expressions are ones that are ultimately evaluated as being equivalent to **`true`** or **`false`**. In flow-control statements, they often include the use of [relational operators](#relational-operators) and/or [boolean operators](#boolean-operators).

#### "Truthy" and "Falsy" Values

While JavaScript has a built-in Boolean data type, the evaluation of ***conditional expressions*** is not strictly confined to `true` or `false` values. A conditional expression, in JavaScript, can also be something that is *truthy* or *falsy*.

JavaScript regards all of the following as being equivalent to a `false` value (and refers to these as **falsy** values).

- `undefined` - No value has been assigned
- `null` - The absense of any value
- `NaN` - Not-a-Number
- `0` - The numeric value zero
- `""` - An empty string
- `{}` - An empty object

Anything that is not false (or *falsy*) is regarded as equivalent to `true`. Besides the `true` keyword, some samples of *truthy* values include the following: `42`, `'bob'`, `'\n'`, `{ key: 'value' }`.


<Aside type="tip">
  The `undefined` an `null` values are both consider *nullish*. The keywords themselves are regarded as both *values* and *types*. While the difference between the two might seem confusing, you should be aware that they are *not* the same thing.

  For a discussion of differences, see <LinkButton target="_blank" icon='external' href="https://medium.com/@stephenthecurt/a-brief-history-of-null-and-undefined-in-javascript-c283caab662e">A brief history of Null and Undefined in JavaScript</LinkButton>.
</Aside>


#### Relational Operators

JavaScript has the following relational operators. These are all **binary operators**, meaning that there must be some identifier or expression on both sides of the operator

- `==` - "Is equal to"
- `===` - Strict equality
- `!=` - "Not equal to"
- `!==` - Strict inequality
- `>` - Greater Than
- `>=` - Greater Than or Equal To
- `<` - Less Than
- `<=` - Less Than or Equal To

#### Boolean Operators

JavaScript has the following boolean operators. 

- `&&` - Logical "And"
- `||` - Logical "Or"
- `!` - Logical "Not"

The logical "And" (`&&`) and "Or" (`||`) operators are **binary operators**, meaning that some identifier or expression is required on both sides of the operator. The logical "Not" (`!`) operator is a **unary operator** where an identifier or expression is expected to be on the right-hand side of the operator.

Two "Not" operators can be used to *coerce* or force an identifier into a strict `true` or `false` value. For example, in the following code the value of `!!myObject` will be forced to `true` if `myObject` is *truthy* or `false` otherwise.

```js "!!" title="Boolean Coercion"
let myObject;
// some intervening code that sets the value
let success = !!myObject;
if(success) {
  // do something
}
```

To understand the effects of boolean operations, consider the following **truth table**. It illustrates the resulting value from performing "And" and "Or" operations.

| `a` | `b` | Logical AND<br />`a && b` | Logical OR<br />`a \|\| b` | Logical NOT<br />`!a` |
|:---:|:---:|:--------:|:----------:|:---:|
| `true` | `true` | `true` | `true` | `false` |
| `true` | `false` | `false` | `true` | `false` |
| `false` | `true` | `false` | `true` | `true` |
| `false` | `false` | `false` | `false` | `true` |

----

### If-Else ⁉️

```js
if(conditionalExpression)
   statementOrStatementBlock // true side
else
   statementOrStatementBlock // false side
```

The **if-else** provides **alternate paths of logic**, where

- `conditionalExpression` is an expression whose ultimate data type is a `bool`.
- the `else` portion is optional.

For example:

```js title="Sample Code"
```

----

### Switch-Case ⁉️

```csharp
switch(cardinalExpression)
{
   case matchingExpression1:
   statementOrStatementBlock
   break;
   case matchingExpression2:
   statementOrStatementBlock
   break;
   // ...additional case statements...
   default:
   statementOrStatementBlock
   break;
}
```

The **switch** provides **alternate paths of logic**, where
: `cardinalExpression` is an expression that produces a single value of any primitive data type (`int`, `double`, `char`, `string` or an `enum`).
: Each `matchingExpression` is a constant value whose data type matches the data type of the `cardinalExpression`. A match is determined by the value of the `cardinalExpression` being **equal to** the `matchingExpression`. The `break` indicates the end of the path of logic for the matching expression.
: `statementOrStatementBlock` is either a **single** statement or a **single** statement *block* (zero or more statements inside curly braces - `{ }`).
: The `default` block will execute if `cardinalExpression` did not match any of the listed matching expressions.

For example:

```js title="Sample Code"
```

----

### For ⁉️

The `for` keyword is a flow control structure to provide *looping* capabilities. It comes in four variations:

- **`for`** - The traditional variation of the `while` statement, where factors affecting the repetition are contained in the parenthesis.
- **`for...in`** - 
- **`for...of`** -
- **`for await...of`** - 

#### `for` Statement

```js "[initialization]" "conditionalExpression" "[incrementation]" "statementOrStatementBlock" title="for Statement"
for([initialization]; conditionalExpression; [incrementation])
   statementOrStatementBlock
```

The **for** provides **repetitive execution of code**, where

- `initialization` is a variable declaration typically including an assignment; the variables identified here should be ones used in the `conditionalExpression`. This portion is optional, but when declaring the variable you should use the `let` or `var` keywords.
- `conditionalExpression` is an expression whose ultimate data type is a `bool`. The `conditionalExpression` is evaluated at the beginning of the loop and may be any "truthy" expression.
- `incrementation` is a modifications to the variable controlling the loop; the variables identified here should be ones used in the `conditionalExpression`. This portion is optional.

For example:

```js title="Sample Code"
for(let count = 0; count < options.length; count++) {
  // code that you want to repeat
}
```

<LinkButton target="_blank" icon='external' variant='secondary' iconPlacement='start' href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for">`for` Keyword on <Badge text="MDN" size="small" variant="note" /></LinkButton>

#### `for...of` Statement

```js "variable" "iterable" "statementOrStatementBlock" title="for...of Statement"
for(variable of iterable)
   statementOrStatementBlock
```

The **`for...of`** provides *repetitive execution of code*, where the repetition occurs for each item in the `iterable`.

- `iterable` is any object that represents a collection of values, such as *Arrays*, *strings*, *`NodeList`* and similar collections.
- `variable` is an identifier to represent each item in the collection as it loops through the collection's items/elements; the variable should be declared with a `let`, `const` or `var`.

For example:

```js title="Sample Code"
for(let )
```

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of


#### `for...in` Statement


#### `for await...of` Statement



----

### While and Do-While ⁉️

```csharp
while(conditionalExpression)
   statementOrStatementBlock
```

The **while** provides **repetitive execution of code**, where
: `conditionalExpression` is an expression whose ultimate data type is a `bool`. The `conditionalExpression` is evaluated at the beginning of the loop.
: `statementOrStatementBlock` is either a **single** statement or a **single** statement *block* (zero or more statements inside curly braces - `{ }`).
  - The `statementOrStatementBlock` will only execute as long as the `contitionalExpression` results in a **`true`** value.
  - The loop exits when the `conditionalStatement` results in a **`false`** value.

```csharp
do
   statementOrStatementBlock
while (conditionalExpression);
```

The **do-while** provides **repetitive execution of code**, where
: `conditionalExpression` is an expression whose ultimate data type is a `bool`. The `conditionalExpression` is evaluated at the end of the loop.
: `statementOrStatementBlock` is either a **single** statement or a **single** statement *block* (zero or more statements inside curly braces - `{ }`).
  - The `statementOrStatementBlock` will execute at least once and will keep on executing as long as the `contitionalExpression` results in a **`true`** value.
  - The loop exits when the `conditionalStatement` results in a **`false`** value.

----

### Function Calls ⁉️

While the [Method Declaration](#method-declarations) *defines a set of instructions*, those instructions only run when the method is *called* from somewhere. The operating system is responsible to call the `Main()` method, but after that, all method calls are the responsibility of our program. The grammar of a method call is as follows.

```csharp
[[ClassName | ObjectName].]MethodName(argumentList)
```

A **Method Call** is an [expression](#expressions) where
: `MethodName` is the programmer-defined name of the method,
: `argumentList` is a comma-separated list of values that correspond to the parameters of the [method declaration](#method-declarations),
: The method is preceded by either a `ClassName` (for `static` methods) or an `ObjectName` (aka: a *variable name*) that identifies *where* the method can be "found"; the **Member Access Operator** (aka: "dot" operator `.`) comes right after the `ClassName` or `ObjectName`. If the method declaration is in the same class as the method call, then the `ClassName`/`ObjectName` can be omitted.

When a method is an *instance* method (non-static) and is called without an `ObjectName`, the `this` keyword is implied. In other words, if the method call looks like

```csharp
Display("Some Text")
```

it is interpreted as

```csharp
this.Display("Some Text")
```

The **`this`** keyword simply means that the method declaration is in the same class as the method call and that it should be applied to the same instance (**`this` instance**) of the class.

----

## Object Literals

- [ ] Object literals are created using curly braces. These curly braces "wrap" the "members" of the objects, effectively creating a **data structure**.
- [ ] The same curly braces can be used to reverse the process, where you can initialize several variables from the values of an object's members. This is known as **destructuring**.

## Classes and Class Members ⁉️

As an object-oriented language, classes play a very prominent part of the code we write in JavaScript. It is within classes, for example, that we place variables (also called *fields*) and methods (which are "*named* sets of instructions"). One of the first things that classes give us developers is a *context* or ***scope*** for the code that we write. Classes are also building blocks, acting as blueprints for new and complex data types that we as programmers can create as we develop richer and more complex computer programs. Classes permeate all the code that we write in JavaScript and are so fundamental that you can't even write a "Hello World" program without them.

---

### Class Definition ⁉️

```csharp
[accessModifier] class ClassName
{
  // FieldDeclarations
  // PropertyDeclarations
  // Constructors
  // MethodDeclarations
}
```

A **Class Definition** describes a new data type where
: `[accessModifier]` is either `public` or `internal`. If no access modifier is provided, then the default modifier is `internal`.
: `ClassName` is the programmer-supplied name for the class (in TitleCase format)
: `FieldDeclarations`, `PropertyDeclarations`, `Constructors` and `MethodDeclarations` are all optional and can appear in any order.
  See the related grammars below to see how they are defined.

---

### Field Declarations ⁉️

```csharp
[accessModifier] [static] dataType _FieldName [= constantExpression];
```

A **Field Declaration** identifies a *static* or *instance* member variable of the class where
: `[accessModifier]` is either `public`, `private`, `protected`, or `internal`. If no access modifier is provided, then the default modifier is `private`.
: `[static]` is an optional keyword. If present, the field is *shared* among all instances of the class. If absent (which is the common case) then the field is an *instance* member and one is created every time an object based on the class is created.
: `dataType` is any built-in data type or the name of a programmer-defined data type.
: `_FieldName` is a the name you give to the member variable. By convention, private fields are given an underscore as a prefix to the name.
: `constantExpression` is an optional expression that generates data whose value can be determined at compile time. Being a constant expression does *not* mean that the field is a constant, only that the initial value stored in the field is a constant and can be known at compile time *before* the program runs.

---

### Property Declarations ⁉️

Properties are a kind of cross between methods and fields. On one hand, they are used in the same way that fields are. When you want to assign (or **set**) a value to a property, you place the property on the left side of the assignment operator. When you want to use (or **get**) the properties value, you simply reference the property name just as you would a field name.

Internally, however, the **get** and **set** operations are like the bodies of a method, where you can place instructions to retrieve or change the data in the class or object. The technical term for the get and set portions of a property is *accessor*.[^1]

[^1]: See the Microsoft docs for [Restricting Accessor Accessibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/restricting-accessor-accessibility)

#### Explicitly Implemented Property ⁉️

Explicitly implemented properties are properties where the programmer supplies the getter and setter implementations. The bodies of the getter and setter may reference a field (known as a **backing store**) that holds the actual information. In these cases, the property is working to provide a **controlled access** to the underlying field's data.

In other situations, a property may merely have a getter where the body of the getter *derives* or *calculates* a value to return from some other source, such as a calculation.

```csharp
[accessModifier] [static] dataType PropertyName
{
    get
    {
        // Body of getter
    }
    set
    {
        // Body of setter
    }
}
```

A **Property Declaration** identifies a *static* or *instance* member of the class where
: `[accessModifier]` is either `public`, `private`, `protected`, or `internal`. If no access modifier is provided, then the default modifier is `private`.
: `[static]` is an optional keyword. If present, the Property is *shared* among all instances of the class. If absent (which is the common case) then the Property is an *instance* member.
: `dataType` is any built-in data type or the name of a programmer-defined data type.
: `PropertyName` is a the name you give to the member property.
: `Body of getter` is a set of instructions that must ultimately return a value of the same data type as the property.
: `Body of the setter` is a set of instructions that can process incoming data that is in the `value` keyword. A typical implementation will store that data into the property's backing store.

### Auto-Implemented Property ⁉️

Auto-Implemented properties are properties where the compiler takes care of the getter and setter implementations and also supplies a hidden field as the **backing store** for the property. The default get implementation is to retrieve the value from the backing store while the default set implementation is to place a value into the backing store.

```csharp
[accessModifier] [static] dataType PropertyName { get; set; }
```

A **Property Declaration** identifies a *static* or *instance* member of the class where
: `[accessModifier]` is either `public`, `private`, `protected`, or `internal`. If no access modifier is provided, then the default modifier is `private`.
: `[static]` is an optional keyword. If present, the Property is *shared* among all instances of the class. If absent (which is the common case) then the Property is an *instance* member.
: `dataType` is any built-in data type or the name of a programmer-defined data type.
: `PropertyName` is a the name you give to the member property.

### Method Declarations ⁉️

```csharp
[accessModifier] [static] returnType MethodName(ParameterList)
{
    // body of method
}
```

A **Method Declaration** defines a *named* set of instructions.
: `[accessModifier]` is either `public`, `private`, `protected`, or `internal`. If no access modifier is provided, then the default modifier is `private`.
: `[static]` is an optional keyword. If present, the method is *shared* among all instances of the class. If absent (which is the common case) then the method is an *instance* member.
: `returnType` is any built-in data type or the name of a programmer-defined data type. The return type signifies the kind of information that the method will return. If the method does not return any information, then the keyword `void` is used as the return type.
: `MethodName` is a the name you give to the method.
: `ParameterList` is a comma-separated list of individual variable declarations.

### Constructors ⁉️

```csharp
[accessModifier] ClassName(ParameterList)
{
    // body of constructor
}
```

A **Constructor** is a set of instructions used when **instantiating** (creating) an object.
: `[accessModifier]` is either `public`, `private`, `protected`, or `internal`. If no access modifier is provided, then the default modifier is `private`.
: `ClassName` - All constructors use the name of the class to which they belong as the name of the constructor.
: `ParameterList` is a comma-separated list of individual variable declarations.
: Classes never return any information - they are simply blocks of instructions used to set up the **initial state** of the object.

## Objects, Classes and More


### Object Instantiation ⁉️

```csharp
new ClassName(argList)
```

### Initializer Lists ⁉️

```csharp
new ClassName
{
  initializerList
}
```

### Classes and Inheritance ⁉️

```csharp
[accessModifier] class ClassName : BaseClassOrInterface[, InterfaceList]
{
  // ClassMembers
}
```

This grammar offers additional details over the earlier [**Class Definition**](#class-definition), where
: `BaseClassOrInterface` is the name of either another class or an [interface](#interface-declaration)
: `InterfaceList` is a comma-separated list of interface names
