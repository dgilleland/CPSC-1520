This page holds various notes/items from old repos I am cleaning up/removing from my GitHub account. I'm just recording these here in case I think they are worth keeping for future refactoring.

## Setting up VS Code as your Git diff tool

You can set up VS code as your tool to perform merge conflicts. To do this, you set it as your **difftool** and your **mergetool** in your .gitconfig file. This can be done manually (by finding your .gitconfig file on your computer), or by running some commands in the command window/powershell.

```shell
git config --global diff.tool vscode
git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait --diff "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"'
git config --global difftool.prompt false

git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait --resume "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"'
```

## Git Commands

> Alternate explanations from an older repo.

- `git init` – This command is used to initialize (set up) a git repository in the current directory. When a git repository is set up, there will be a hidden folder named ".git" that contains all the history of commits for the repository.
- `git add .` – This command is used to stage un-tracked and modified files for a commit. If a file is not being tracked (and is not listed in .gitignore), this command will mark the file as a new item for the repository to track. If a file has been modified, then this command will mark it as ready to be committed.
- `git status` – This command is used to give you the status of your code repository.
- `git commit -m "message"` – The commit command is used to save staged files to the repository. When a commit occurs, all of the files staged for committal are compared against the last commit, and the changes between them becomes the new commit. Additionally, the user is identified for the commit (typically by a user name and e-mail) - this is called blame.
- `git pull` – This command is used to get a remote repository and merge it with the local repository. Remote repositories are typically hosted online.
- `git push` – This command is used to take the local repository and send/merge it with a remote repository.

## Programmatically List GitIgnore Templates

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Net.Http; // for HttpClient
using static System.Console; // Allows me to directly call static methods on the Console class, without the classname qualifier

namespace Repo
{
    class Program
    {
        const string API_BASE = "https://gitignore.io/api/";
        const string API_LINES = API_BASE + "list?format=lines";

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Use the HttpClient to grab content from a website
            var client = new HttpClient();
            var response = client.GetAsync(API_LINES,HttpCompletionOption.ResponseContentRead).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
            var templateLines = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();
            WriteLine(templateLines);
        }
    }
}
```
