An array represents an *ordered collection* of items. Arrays allow developers to work with collections of values as a single item or object. In fact, JavaScript arrays are built upon the base `Object` type and are identified as `object` when checked with the `typeof` keyword.

## Array Properties

### `.length`

The `.length` property of an array indicates the number of items (elements) in the array.

## Array Functions

### Adding to an Array

The `.push()` function is used to add an item to the end of an array.

The `.unshift()` function is used to add an item to the start of an array.

When attempting to insert an item into the middle of the array, there are several approaches you can take.

- Use the `.splice()` function
- Use the spread operator (`...`) along with `.splice()`

### Removing from an Array

The `.pop()` function is used to remove the last item from an array.

The `.shift()` function is used to remove the first item from an array.

The `.splice()` function is used to remove one or more items from any part of the array.

### Iterating over Arrays

The nature of arrays having their values accessible via an *index* makes it quite easy to loop through an array with a `for` statement. There are other ways to iterate over an array.

- `for..in` can be used to iterate over the *index values* of the array.
- `for..of` can be used to iterate over the *entries* of the array.
- `.forEach()` can be used to apply a function to each entry in the array. This is a very versatile function, as it accepts a callback that will receive three values as it iterates over each item: the *entry* (or element) of the array, the *index* of that element, and the complete array itself.

### Searching and Transforming Arrays

The `.find()`, `.findIndex()`, `.findLast()`, and `.findLastIndes()` can be used to retrieve a single element or index position in an array, starting either from the beginning or the end. These functions do not modify the contents of the original array.

The `.filter()` function can be used to retrieve multiple items from an array. The parameter of this function is a callback that acts as a *predicate*. That is, the callback is expected to be a function that returns a `true` or `false` value indicating whether that item should be included in the array returned by `.filter()`. This function does not modify the contents of the original array.

The `.map()` function is used to generate a new array where the elements of the existing array can be "transformed" or used in generating new data. This function does not modify the contents of the original array.
