## Managing Node Projects

### Removing `node_modules` Folders

As you create more and more Node projects, you will find several `node_modules` folders littering your computer. It's not unusual, especially after months or years of exploratory work or self-learning, to have dozens or even hundreds of `node_modules` folders on your system. That can eat up a *lot* of computer space!

Try using <a href="https://npkill.js.org/" target="_blank">**npkill**</a> to clean up your system. Just open a stand-alone terminal on your computer and run the following.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="npm">
        ```ps
        npx npkill
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="pnpm">
        ```ps
        pnpm dlx npkill
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
